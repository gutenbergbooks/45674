<h2 class="p4"><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn p2">In the preparation of the verses that fill these pages I have
been helped by some of the prisoners of this institution. The
donors have been somewhat few, for which I return thanks;
but each and every verse is a fair representation of the
many phases that the mind of a prisoner passes through, and of
his true sentiment. Those that have been donated by my fellow
prisoners are accredited to them by either their name or serial
number. Some of the verses have been published in our prison
"<span class="smcap">News</span>," but inasmuch as they have reached only an inconsiderable
few outside the prison walls, I prepare this little
volume and hand it to the wide, wide world. My motto, in so
doing, is:</p>

<p>May you who enjoy the blessings of liberty and worldly freedom,
partake with us of our solitary musings, and enjoy our
noblest thoughts and resolutions, as well as for us to enjoy
yours; and that you may know that we are not devoid of true,
manly, noble principle simply because we are cast&mdash;some justly,
others unjustly&mdash;into prison.</p>

<p>May we exchange greetings with you all&mdash;shake&mdash;and if by
chance I have been fortunate enough to interest you, I am well
compensated; but if I have been more fortunate, and given you&mdash;even
one of you&mdash;a line of noble, good thoughts and advice&mdash;I
say, "May the seed fall on good ground and bring forth good
fruit; may it not be wasted upon barren rock." In my work on
"Crime and Criminals" many of these verses will appear in the
"Appendix."</p>

<p class="pf1">Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="pf2">H. P. McKNIGHT,</p>

<p class="pn">True models of poetic art.<br />
Should please the ear and touch the heart:<br />
Stamp on the plastic mind of youth<br />
Due reverence for Eternal Truth.<br />
Paint field and flower in nature's hues,<br />
Give to the world the heart's best news,<br />
Or, lightly tripping o'er the page,<br />
Rejuvenate the blood of age.<br />
The sacred Muse should ne'er descend.<br />
Vice to guild, nor wound a friend.<br />
Heaven gave no man poetic art,<br />
Save to improve the human heart.</p>

<p class="pn p2">You may not find, in coming page,<br />
The ripened wisdom of the age:<br />
Yet you <i>will</i> find, untrained by art,<br />
The deathless music of the heart:<br />
And truth shall caress each flaming line.<br />
Inspired by The Tuneful Nine;<br />
No fear of man nor greed of praise<br />
Shall make or mar our tuneful lays;<br />
We simply voice the ripest thought<br />
Of prisoned souls with meaning fraught.<br />
Yours it is to praise or blame<br />
My effort to deserve a name!</p>

Go read some master of the Nine!<br />
Good taste perhaps you will display;<br />
Let others read my simple lay<br />
That gushes from an honest heart<br />
Unawed by fear, unstrained by art.<br />
I ne'er will prostitute my Muse<br />
The rich to praise, nor poor abuse;<br />
But simply sing as best I can<br />
Whate'er may bless my fellow man;<br />
I dare not stain a single page<br />
With outbursts of unreasoning rage,<br />
But if one sorrow I can soothe<br />
Or one his rugged pathway smooth;<br />
One pain relieve, one joy impart,<br />
'Twill ease the burden of a heart<br />
That has known for weary years<br />
No solace save unbidden tears.<br />
Hard is the heart that will refuse<br />
Due merit to the Prison Muse.<br />
May heaven watch the prisoner's weal<br />
And mankind for his sorrow feel!</p>

<p class="pl0">In contravention of the laws of right,</p>
<p class="pl0">Man's cruel passion and his guilty might,</p>
<p class="pl0">Has bound me tightly with a galling chain</p>
<p class="pl0">Of heaped-up malice and unjust disdain!</p>
<p class="pl0">From front rank lawyer to a felon's cell,</p>
<p class="pl0">Through perjured villains, not by sin I fell!</p>
<p class="pl0">By fiat law my body was consigned</p>
<p class="pl0">To this grim cell for guilty ones designed.</p>
<p class="pl0">Yet I'm no convict&mdash;I have never known</p>
<p class="pl0">The deep remorse by guilty wretches shown!</p>
<p class="pl0">I am a martyr&mdash;doomed by adverse fate</p>
<p class="pl0">To brave the billows of malicious hate!</p>
<p class="pl0">Yet I am free, for Nature's august plan</p>
<p class="pl0">Makes MIND not <i>matter</i> constitute the MAN.</p>

<p class="pl2">Tho' men may curse me and cast out my name,</p>
<p class="pl0">Like some vile bauble on the sea of shame;</p>
<p class="pl0">Brand me as murderer or catiff thief,</p>
<p class="pl0">Or atheistic infidel&mdash;steepid in unbelief;</p>
<p class="pl0">Foe to all that's pure and good&mdash;wretch unfit to live;</p>
<p class="pl0">Outlaw whom no honest man can even pity give!</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Yet my soul will still defy your prison bolts and bars,</p>
<p class="pl0">And soaring far on eager wings beyond the faintest stars,</p>
<p class="pl0">Live in a world to you unknown, where only poet soul</p>
<p class="pl0">Can bask in beauty undefiled by cankering control!</p>
<p class="pl0">In vain is all your hate and scorn&mdash;vain your prison blight;</p>
<p class="pl0">God loves me, and I feel assured that all will yet be right!</p>
<p class="pl0">I know one law&mdash;a perfect law, by Nature's self designed&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">'Tis Heaven's dearest gift to man&mdash;The Freedom of the Mind!</p>

<p class="pl4">If minds and hearts were easy read as faces we can see,</p>
<p class="pl0">Society would lose its dread and many a prisoner free!</p>
<p class="pl0">But what, alas! do people care what's in another's brain?</p>
<p class="pl0">They only seek to hide their share of misery and pain.</p>
<p class="pl0">Were all compelled to truthful be and show their inner life&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">Great heavens! what a jamboree of sin and shame and strife!</p>
<p class="pli">How few would measure half a span if Mind alone we closely scan!</p>
<p class="pl0">Where is the man on this broad earth, so pure, so good, so true,</p>
<p class="pl0">That never gave an action birth he dared not bring to view?</p>
<p class="pl0">The Christ alone was sinless here, none other lives aright;</p>
<p class="pl0">All human goodness springs from fear of death's approaching night!</p>
<p class="pl0">There is no soul so white I know but what temptation's power</p>
<p class="pl0">Its purity can overthrow and all its good deflower!</p>
<p class="pli">Disguise the truth as best we can, he <i>errs</i> the most who most is <i>Man!</i></p>

<p class="pl2">Come, let us take a journey, with cathode rays supplied,</p>
<p class="pl0">And view the greatest and good in all their pomp and pride!</p>
<p class="pl0">Examine first the churches, where the godly crew</p>
<p class="pl0">Teach poor erring mortals what is best to do.</p>
<p class="pl0">They tell us human nature is <i>once</i> and always wrong,</p>
<p class="pl0">And prove man's deep depravity in sermon or by song.</p>
<p class="pl0">All natural passion is denounced as deep and deadly sin,</p>
<p class="pl0">And <i>truth</i> and <i>virtue</i> painted as graces hard to win.</p>
<p class="pl0">Heaven, they tell us, is a place with blisses running o'er;</p>
<p class="pl0">Hell, a lake of torture, where fiery billows roar!</p>
<p class="pl0">A choice eternal all must make between their birth and death;</p>
<p class="pl0">It may be made in early life or with expiring breath!</p>
<p class="pl0">But how this choice must be made each gives a separate plan,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>That clearly proves how narrow is the erring mind of Man.</p>

<p class="pl2">One tells us naught but good pursue, all evil to eschew;</p>
<p class="pl0">Another swears without God's grace no mortal thus can do;</p>
<p class="pl0">One bids us work salvation out with trembling and with fear,</p>
<p class="pl0">Another swears that God's elect should never shed a tear;</p>
<p class="pl0">One says all must live the life Jesus lived on earth.</p>
<p class="pl0">Another says it can't be done without a Second Birth!</p>
<p class="pl0">Some say <i>work</i>, others <i>trust</i>, others still say <i>wait</i>;</p>
<p class="pl0">Some deem us mere automatons, saved or lost by <i>Fate!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Some, with philanthropic views, declare all must be saved,</p>
<p class="pl0">Since Christ, the Perfect Offering for <i>all</i>, death's horrors braved!</p>
<p class="pl0">Since Christians never will agree, 'tis best that every man</p>
<p class="pl0">Should listen to his conscience, and do the best he can!</p>
<p class="pl0">God ever <i>has</i> and <i>will</i> do right! In His Eternal Plan</p>

<p class="pl0">He looks a model Christian&mdash;just turn on him your light.</p>
<p class="pl0">Great heavens! what a medley of <i>cant</i> and sin and shame!</p>
<p class="pl0">If the half we see was ever told 'twould ruin his good name!</p>
<p class="pl0">But turn on yonder pastor your strange, mysterious light;</p>
<p class="pl0">I know he is a real good man, who loves Eternal Right.</p>
<p class="pl0">Ye holy saints, protect us! <i>he</i> too has gone amiss!</p>
<p class="pl0">When Siren Voice allured him with a seductive kiss!</p>
<p class="pl0">If half the prayers we utter be not a sounding lie,</p>
<p class="pl0">It is but little marvel that we are doomed to die!</p>
<p class="pl0">For each will plead forgiveness for thought or action done,</p>
<p class="pl0">And <i>none</i> by spotless merit eternal bliss hath won.</p>
<p class="pl0">Then gently judge your fellow, his failings lightly scan;</p>
<p class="pl0">Like you, he can not corner <i>all</i> the brains of man!</p>

<p class="pl2">See, yonder is our Congress, where wits and fools unite,</p>
<p class="pl0">To declare by the nation's statute what <i>is</i> fundamental right!</p>
<p class="pl0">They yell of patriotism and the majesty of Law,</p>
<p class="pl0">And are for once unanimous&mdash;their salaries to draw!</p>
<p class="pl0">Alas! alas! 'tis ever thus within our halls of State;</p>
<p class="pl0">Sweet Justice is blacklisted&mdash;the <i>dollar</i> is too great.</p>
<p class="pl0">Aye, even on judicial bench, where justice should be done,</p>

<p class="pl0">Lawyers, judge and jury <i>exparte</i> view the case&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">An angel would be ruined in the defendant's place!</p>
<p class="pl0">In vain is protestation, in vain a blameless life;</p>
<p class="pl0">Some <i>must be</i> doomed to prison when prejudice is rife!</p>
<p class="pl0">Law must keep its servants in stations high and proud,</p>

<p class="pl2">The modern Shylock of today, unlike his friend of old,</p>
<p class="pl0">Demands the pound of quivering flesh and <i>all</i> his victim's gold;</p>
<p class="pl0">Nor feels content until he sees his victim's hated face</p>
<p class="pl0">Behind a wall of rock and steel in garments of disgrace.</p>
<p class="pl0">Then he will raise his dainty hands and loud applaud the law</p>
<p class="pl0">That <i>can</i> protect such beings, who live without a flaw.</p>
<p class="pl0"><i>He</i> has no pity for the weak, who thro' temptation fall,</p>
<p class="pl0">But freely spends his <i>time</i> and <i>means</i> the guileless to enthrall.</p>
<p class="pl0">He heaps <i>his</i> mighty wrath and scorn on every evil done,</p>
<p class="pl0">And speaks in tones of pure disgust of poverty's pale son.</p>
<p class="pl0">But if you bid him look within and study his own heart,</p>
<p class="pl0">He has a task herculean&mdash;'tis such a <i>tiny</i> part!</p>
<p class="pl0">And as for Mind&mdash;ye angels! in fair creation's plan</p>

<p class="pl2">The modern Clytemnestra no dagger needs to use;</p>
<p class="pl0">She slays her Agamemnon within your <i>legal</i> pews,</p>
<p class="pl0">Since judges now are willing to sunder marriage ties,</p>
<p class="pl0">And juries are so truculent when blushing beauty lies.</p>
<p class="pl0">Or if she be a <i>Helen</i>, and Paris suits her taste,</p>
<p class="pl0">She hastes without compunction to lay her honor waste.</p>
<p class="pl0">"Society" allows her to have "a special friend,"</p>
<p class="pl0">And a husband is <i>so</i> handy her good name to defend!</p>
<p class="pl0">But alas! Aspasia <i>no mercy</i> need expect;</p>
<p class="pl0">Her Pericles <i>lionized</i>, but none <i>her</i> worth detect!</p>
<p class="pl0">And as for poor Thargelia <i>none</i> will take <i>her</i> part;</p>
<p class="pl0">She lives a social outcast, with broken, bleeding heart;</p>
<p class="pl0">But each base seducer, in our social plan.</p>
<p class="pl0">Makes poor, trusting woman bear the sins of <i>Man!</i></p>

<p class="pl2">Many men are now misjudged, and meet an awful fate,</p>
<p class="pl0">Whose innocence is published, but alas, it is too late!</p>
<p class="pl0">Many, too, are breathing freedom's precious air</p>
<p class="pl0">Whose vile conduct merits prison dress and fare.</p>
<p class="pl0">Only <i>little</i> rascals in your prisons <i>die</i>,</p>
<p class="pl0">While <i>stupendous</i> villians liberty can buy!</p>
<p class="pl0">Each one strives with fervor his neighbor to outshine,</p>
<p class="pl0">And he who has the most of gold is reckoned half divine.</p>
<p class="pl0">You scatter dark temptations around the poor man's path,</p>
<p class="pl0">And when he falls you pour on him <i>all</i> your vicious wrath.</p>
<p class="pl0">Poverty in public lives all her deeds are seen;</p>
<p class="pl0">Wealth can build a castle her <i>wickedness</i> to screen.</p>
<p class="pl0">Yet many a noble woman and kingly man is found</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>As toilers in your factories or tillers of the ground!</p>

<p class="pl2">If cathode rays were freely used to bring to human sight</p>
<p class="pl0">The dirty methods villians use to <i>damn</i> Eternal Right,</p>
<p class="pl0">Many men would be set free and others take their place</p>
<p class="pl0">Who now can roll in luxury and laugh at their disgrace.</p>
<p class="pl0">A judge and jury now can sit and <i>hang</i> a man at will,</p>
<p class="pl0">But they say 'tis open <i>murder</i> if but <i>one</i> dares kill!</p>
<p class="pl0">Take a ring of brass and plate it o'er with gold,</p>
<p class="pl0">And 'tis only <i>business</i> when the fraud is sold!</p>
<p class="pl0">Adulterate both food and drink, deal in deadly pills;</p>
<p class="pl0">Law will aid your <i>robbery</i> and collect your bills!</p>
<p class="pl0">Give to your profession but a sounding name,</p>
<p class="pl0">Then cut up the devil without fear or shame.</p>
<p class="pl0">Be sure to call it <i>business</i> whatever you may do,</p>
<p class="pl0">And if you have sufficient <i>gall</i> that will pull you through.</p>

<p class="pl2">Now throughout this prison rays cathodal dart,</p>
<p class="pl0">And read the hidden secrets of each convict heart.</p>
<p class="pl0">Some have wrought vile deeds, and wrought them o'er and o'er,</p>
<p class="pl0">That surely proves them rotten to their inmost core.</p>
<p class="pl0">And here are wretched fiends, who with consumate art,</p>
<p class="pl0">Ravish every instinct of the human heart.</p>
<p class="pl0">Some men of wit and letters, cultured and refined,</p>
<p class="pl0">Others moral lepers, with heart and conscience blind.</p>
<p class="pl0">From drawing room and brothel, farm and city slum,</p>
<p class="pl0">Some by acts of justice, some through perjury come;</p>
<p class="pl0">The innocent and guilty, callow youth and age,</p>
<p class="pl0">All can be imprisoned in this Christian age!</p>
<p class="pl0">But they who seek for liberty no innocence must plead&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">Gold, and plenty of it, will be all they need.</p>

<p class="pl2">Some young souls are making, for a stated time,</p>
<p class="pl0">This, their maiden effort, on the sea of crime.</p>
<p class="pl0">Oh, Christians, teach them early what to me is plain;</p>
<p class="pl0">Crime ever <i>has</i> and ever <i>will</i> result in lasting pain.</p>
<p class="pl0">Do not be <i>too</i> lenient, nor <i>too</i> soon forgive,</p>
<p class="pl0">Lest all <i>vice</i> should flourish and no <i>virtue</i> live.</p>
<p class="pl0">Society demands it, the <i>guilty</i> should atone&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">But take care you punish those, and those <i>alone!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Keep them in your prisons till by <i>virtue</i> shown</p>

<p class="pl0">But let all be careful lest by <i>word</i> or <i>act</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Those who should <i>reform</i> them from their <i>good</i> subtract.</p>
<p class="pl0">Rule them wisely, gently&mdash;by some <i>humane</i> plan,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>All their faults to conquer as best becomes a MAN.</p>

<p class="pl2">When your work is finished and their habits changed,</p>

<p class="pl0">Both principle and policy declare this course is wise;</p>
<p class="pl0">Then why longer act the fool and wisdom's voice despise?</p>
<p class="pl0">Crime never <i>can</i> nor <i>will</i> decrease until in <i>Wisdom's School</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Men learn the noted lesson, "Right <i>through</i> Law should Rule."</p>
<p class="pl0">All tried plans are failures, this none dares deny;</p>
<p class="pl0">Now give <i>Common Sense</i> a show and failure dare defy.</p>
<p class="pl0">Do <i>this</i>, and lash and pistol, now your sole defense,</p>
<p class="pl0">Shall give place to Reason and plain Common Sense!</p>

<p class="pl2">Courts are far too careless when they give men life</p>
<p class="pl0">For offense unnoticed save in time of strife.</p>
<p class="pl0">Naught but some poor chicken or a ham he stole&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">Shall the devil purchase at such price a soul?</p>
<p class="pl0">If such petty crimes as this deserve such prison fare,</p>
<p class="pl0">Come now, honest reader, what is <i>your</i> just share?</p>
<p class="pl0">Was that old Greek right, who, tho' a man of sense,</p>
<p class="pl0">Could mete out death to all for each small offense?</p>
<p class="pl0">Apply his heartless rule, and can you truly say</p>
<p class="pl0">Any man or woman would be left to slay?</p>
<p class="pl0">Man is only mortal, and to sin is prone;</p>
<p class="pl0">Never cure another's faults till you quit your own.</p>
<p class="pl0">Many are convicted by the <i>press</i> at large;</p>
<p class="pl0">The Public Mind is rarely Heaven's peculiar charge.</p>

<p class="pl2">Bring the judge and jury who declared my fate</p>
<p class="pl0">For the shining dollars furnished them by hate,</p>
<p class="pl0">And their guilty conscience by my own arrange,</p>
<p class="pl0">And then tell me frankly if my fate should change!</p>
<p class="pl0">Yet I had sooner die behind these bars of steel</p>
<p class="pl0">Than to have a heart of stone that <i>could</i> not feel!</p>
<p class="pl0">I know such human tigers, who fatten on distress,</p>
<p class="pl0">Never <i>can</i> and <i>never</i> will enjoy one hour of rest!</p>
<p class="pl0">Until all hate and malice, all greed and other sin</p>
<p class="pl0">Is burned by awful torture to leave them pure within!</p>
<p class="pl0">God <i>will</i> forgive each penitent whate'er his sin may be,</p>

<p class="pl0">Oh listen! brothers, listen&mdash;'tis Jehovah's plan&mdash;</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn">Is living thought, proud condor of the mind,<br />
By walls of rock and iron bars confined,<br />
Innate divinity by human courts enslaved,<br />
And right eternal by a dust-worm braved?<br />
Think you the spirit's rapid flight to mar<br />
With dungeon torture and by iron bar?<br />
Can rock-ribbed walls and bars of steel<br />
Deprive man of the power to feel?<br />
Can you the stream of Lethe roll<br />
In maddening torrents o'er the soul,<br />
Pluck from my brow love's garland fair<br />
And brand me "Victim of despair?"<br />
No! weakling son of vengeful fate,<br />
God grants to none a power so great.<br />
My body is your lawful prey,<br />
Poor lump of spirit-crumbling clay;<br />
Seize, chain and manacle each part,<br />
Aye, even starve my bleeding heart,<br />
But know that for Creative Thought<br />
All fetters by one's self is wrought.<br />
Mind, glorious Mind&mdash;Jehovah's sleepless breath,<br />
Can know no bondage and can feel no death.<br />
In yon fair regions of unreached repose<br />
Eternal Beauty's flower-chalice glows,<br />
Filled to the brim with satisfying wine,<br />
Ambrosial nectar of the Tuneful Nine.<br />
My muse can reach it on external wings<br />
And drink till all the heart within me sings!<br />
I scale the lofty heights, by virtue shown,<br />
And from Eternal Wisdom seek my own.<br />
There, far above the struggling world of fate,<br />
I greet true freedom and am wisely great.<br />
'Tis mine in bright elysian fields to roam,<br />
Pluck jeweled treasure from the sleeping gnome;<br />
Bid ocean deeps their mysteries reveal,<br />
Or, soaring far above the world of space,<br />
Gain raptured visions of the Holy Place;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Admire and measure every glittering throne,<br />
Count heavenly treasure as my own,<br />
Make august angels bow beneath my rod,<br />
And even dare to mould the mind of God;<br />
O radiant fields of pure, untrammeled Thought,<br />
With what sweet incense are thy zephyrs fraught;<br />
How clear the view, from thy exalted height,<br />
Of human errors and unerring right;<br />
'Tis thou alone my laboring Muse can teach<br />
The perfect measure of her powers to reach;<br />
She cons these fragments of a Truth sublime,<br />
And art stands ready with appropriate rhyme<br />
To trim each sentence and each word to place<br />
In melting numbers of seductive grace;<br />
Since first Jehovah, bending low to earth,<br />
Breathed in man's nostrils an eternal birth,<br />
The rain drop falling, from the heavy cloud,<br />
In waiting dust, finds ready shroud,<br />
And there commingling fills each separate cell,<br />
Yet still remains as pure as when it fell:<br />
To man appearing but a dampened clod,<br />
'Tis chambered favor of a gracious God;<br />
And serves his purpose till He calls above<br />
This liquid semblance of Immortal Love,<br />
There <i>not</i> to perish, but return again<br />
To deck the forest and adorn the plain;<br />
All nature feels its fructifying power<br />
In laughing streamlets and in nodding flower;<br />
The rain drop typifies the Pure Indwelling God,<br />
That permeates our being, to animate a clod;<br />
Give birth to all emotion, consistent with His plan,<br />
And with unmeasured tenderness weep the fall of man.<br />
From every nodding flower, from every whispering breeze<br />
From mountain's lofty height, from towering trees,<br />
From softly twinkling star, from lightning's giddy flash,<br />
From the softest twitter of a bird and thunder's awful crash,<br />
From hills the ants may call their own,<br />
From crested elders 'round their throne,<br />
From babbling brook, from storm-lashed wave,<br />
From nature smiling, nature grave,<br />
From earth and air, from sky and sea,<br />
There comes the self same voice to me,<br />
Like softest note of cooing dove,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>And sweetly whispers, "<span class="smcap">God is Love</span>."<br />
All nature is obedient to heaven's august plan,<br />
And none will dare rebellion, save ever-erring man.<br />
He, of a dual nature&mdash;purity and lust&mdash;<br />
Defies his Great Creator and thus betrays his trust.<br />
Thrones within his being the hydra-headed sin,<br />
All his joy to murder and create <i>hell within</i>;<br />
Self-conscienceness completes the triple blow<br />
While memories of happier years augments his hapless woe.<br />
Whatever then of pleasure his wounded spirit knows<br />
From the fountain of bitter repentance it onward, onward flows,<br />
His own environment, be it either fair or fell,<br />
Must <i>now</i> embower his heaven, or will create his hell.<br />
Contentment, peace, or pleasure he must create anew<br />
By sowing seeds of virtue where vice so lately grew.<br />
He learns he must not do whatever man can do,<br />
But recognize the limits of the just and true.<br />
Law is his <i>Alma mater</i>, the measure of his right,<br />
The barrier Jehovah set to curb irreverent flight;<br />
He has the truest liberty who recognizes law;<br />
'Tis made to shield his virtues and on his vices war;<br />
He who denies humanity lives for himself alone<br />
All history to hush, all culture to disown;<br />
And quickly he relapses into a barbarous state,<br />
Where only force and prowess can make the unit great.<br />
None so lost to <i>virtue</i>, none so devoid of art,<br />
As he who fails to capture the <i>empire of a heart</i>;<br />
He who knows not sympathy feels no fellow's woe,<br />
Will never feel the rapture of happiness below;<br />
God planted seeds of pity in every human breast,<br />
And he who loses most of woe secures most of rest:<br />
Love is man's <i>all</i>, his conqueror, his cordial and wine,<br />
The measure of his inner life that stamps him as divine.<br />
How circumscribed the circle God allots to man,<br />
His home is but an acre, his life is but a span;<br />
And yet within that circle his influence is so great<br />
He wakes the cooing notes of <i>love</i> or feeds the fires of hate;<br />
His influence is potential within a circle small,<br />
But beyond the limit of the same he does no good at all;<br />
All thought, all power with which our being teems,<br />
Is action predicated on events or on dreams.<br />
All we have seen or heard, all we now can feel,<br />
Leaves an imprint on the heart that the future must reveal:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>The vain are truly lonely, they long to be admired,<br />
One wishes to be understood, another well attired,<br />
This hushed by useless longings or fashion's changing art,<br />
That sweetest of all poems, <i>the music of the heart</i>.<br />
But he who solves life's mystery is never quite alone,<br />
All ages is his playground and solitude his throne;<br />
He walks in subtle converse with all the mighty dead,<br />
Gathering priceless jewels their wit or wisdom bred.<br />
The watchtowers of his thought o'erlooks the struggling mass,<br />
While events both past and present before his vision pass.<br />
He sees the weary captive tugging at his chain;<br />
The weather-beaten sailor plough the raging main;<br />
The swarthy burden bearer in forest, mine and field;<br />
The merchant's soiled ledgers, the soldier's brazen shield;<br />
The child with glittering toy, the maiden at her glass;<br />
The ruler of an empire, the leader of the mass;<br />
The student in his study, the priest on bended knee;<br />
The teacher with his ferrule, the aged human tree,<br />
All fondly dream of freedom, yet all beneath the ban,<br />
Each in a separate prison presided o'er by <i>man</i>;<br />
Sees <i>nature</i> and <i>morality</i> are ever waging war,<br />
The first as god of freedom, the latter lord of law.<br />
Sees culture raise her barriers between polite and rude,<br />
And hears <i>Religion</i> thunder, "Cover up the nude!"<br />
Knows man in every station to be a willing slave,<br />
The football of his passion, the dupe of every knave.<br />
Yet hears him boast his freedom, laud his reasoning power;<br />
Rule all he can with iron hand, and <i>finite</i> judgment shower;<br />
Sees all the devious, hidden paths by sinful mortals trod<br />
Where <i>human</i> law and custom dare ostracise a god;<br />
Yet knows a germ of goodness, deep in the human breast,<br />
Is living in the worst of men however much depressed.<br />
Knows life is but the unit of God's Eternal Plan,<br />
And learns to <i>pity</i>, not to blame, poor ever-erring man!<br />
In each created atom sees faultless beauty glow<br />
And God's Eternal purpose in onward sequence flow.<br />
Views all souls as living harps, whose seeming dissonance<br />
Is but apparent and not real; and believes, perchance,<br />
God will mend each shattered chord, tune the quivering lyre,<br />
And from out each soul shall bring a music sweeter, higher<br />
Than earthly ears have ever heard or earthly lips essayed;<br />
Such music as the ransomed sing in innocence arrayed;<br />
While all the universe entranced shall wondering inquire:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>"Is this the fruitage of <i>His</i> woe? Is this his soul's desire?<br />
Is this the harp so late unstrung? Is this poor fallen man?<br />
Ah! can it be that all was wrought obedient to God's plan"?</p>

<p class="pn p1">Nature will o'er matter bear imperial sway,<br />
And all not immortal must in time decay;<br />
Man's tenement is mortal, but himself divine;<br />
Which should he most cherish, the jewel or its shrine?<br />
Yet when vice allures him with seductive ray,<br />
Gives he not to passion undisputed sway?<br />
Dreams he not of beauty who, with open arms,<br />
Calls for lust to enter and revel 'mid her charms?<br />
Is his eye not captive? Do not his senses thrill?<br />
What is left the tempted one save his feeble will?<br />
If that will prove recreant to Jehovah's trust,<br />
Pays he not the penalty in self-consuming lust?<br />
Must his spirit suffer through unending years<br />
For the shame he purchased with agonizing tears?<br />
Life is but a shoe-broom, Nature is God's book<br />
And he's the aptest scholar who all her laws can brook!<br />
If love of right was constant man could well defy<br />
All of sin's allurements and unspotted die!<br />
<i>One</i> such man has lived who, with a faith sublime,<br />
Crucified the temple where he dwelt in time,<br />
And entered heaven victorious without the aid of grace,<br />
The marvel of all centuries, the Savior of the race;<br />
But had His will but weakened, Jesus, too, had fell,<br />
And man without Redemption sank tottering into hell;<br />
All would be good did not true goodness claim<br />
Such earnest noble effort from a will so tame;<br />
<i>Crime</i> is but a sequence of misguided will<br />
Inherent moral defect and <i>surrounding</i> ill.<br />
Man's innate love of beauty and his dread of pain,<br />
His ever raging thirst for power and his greed for gain<br />
Alternately do sway him with resistless power,<br />
The spotless blossoms of the soul, until he only yearns<br />
For the ever hideous lust that blackens as it burns.<br />
Guilt comes not, thundering on the wings of time,<br />
With vice-distorted feature and the leer of crime,<br />
But like enchanting vision from a pagan dream,<br />
Or softly echoed cadence of a whispering stream,<br />
She steals upon us gently, with ever-changing art,<br />
And usurps an empire&mdash;the waiting human heart!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Her outward form is beauty, her voice with Passion tense,<br />
She only craves the privilege to gratify each sense;<br />
All apparent pleasures 'round her path are spread,<br />
But, alas! you seize the flower to find its fragrance fled;<br />
But still pursuing, row with bated breath,<br />
You clasp her to your bosom and&mdash;embrace a death!<br />
Then, conscience stricken, you the wreck survey,<br />
And with shuddering sorrow&mdash;humbly kneel to pray;<br />
While the pitying angels on their pinions bear<br />
The ever sacred burden of repentant prayer,<br />
And almighty love descending reasserts control,<br />
And mercy in the guise of grace has won a human <i>soul</i>;<br />
But contrast a moment, with this heavenly plan,<br />
The awful brutal conduct of exacting <span class="smcap">Man</span>.<br />
See yon martial champion riding on the flood<br />
Of a frightful carnage and a sea of blood;<br />
His path is strewn with many a ghastly sight,<br />
Dead and dismembered bodies and defenseless fright!<br />
Yet all the people with a loud acclaim<br />
Pronounce <i>him</i> "<i>Hero</i>," and accord him Fame!<br />
True, he butchers thousands in a cruel war,<br />
Yet you deem him <i>guiltless</i>, he obeyed <i>your</i> law.<br />
But if your angered brother slay a single man,<br />
<i>Him</i> you brand a "Murderer," worthy of your ban;<br />
And with zeal unbounded you wage relentless war<br />
Until he falls, a victim to rage-created law.<br />
As if a useless <i>murderer</i>, sanctioned by the state,<br />
Was less the fruitage of revenge than one new-born of hate;<br />
Perchance in some fair aiden, some far distant sphere<br />
Your poor hapless victim these just words may hear:<br />
"Thou art now forgiven, poor misguided son!<br />
"Tho' tranced with dire passion thou hast slain but one.<br />
"Thou hast made atonement, breathed a fiery breath<br />
"Of a deep repentance and an awful death!<br />
"Place on him the raiment&mdash;whiter far than snow,<br />
"And teach his untried lips to sing the song the angels know.<br />
"But as to yonder soldier who for the bauble fame<br />
"Led unbattled thousands without fear or shame;<br />
"And with banners flying to the bugle's chime<br />
"Hurled obedient legions into conscious crime&mdash;<br />
"All the tears he showed, <i>all</i> the blood he shed,<br />
"Now in molten fire shall circle 'round his head,<br />
"And all shall learn the lesson, that horror-breeding war<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>"Will <i>never</i> meet the sanction of Jehovah's law!"<br />
This is no fancy picture, nor idle dream of youth,<br />
But, if I know the laws of God, it is the solemn truth".</p>

<p class="pn p1">Behold a homeless wanderer, poor and thinly clad,<br />
To biting cold a victim, with hunger almost mad,<br />
Entering yonder mansion, dares to boldly steal<br />
What none should e'er deny a dog&mdash;the pittance of a meal!<br />
See the greedy sleuth-hounds of the outraged law<br />
Wage against this robber an unrelenting war;<br />
While <i>Christian</i> judge and jury, with ready wit, declare<br />
His crime an awful outrage, that merits prison fare!<br />
But he who rears his costly domes<br />
O'er wreck and ruin of human homes,<br />
Plants in the breast a raging thirst<br />
And leaves his victims doubly cursed,<br />
Can roll in luxury, loll in pride<br />
And, with <i>the law</i>, his gain divide!<br />
Tho' every dime he pays the state<br />
A thousand cost in wakened hate!</p>

<p class="pn p1">A simple youth by passion lured,<br />
And of but little wisdom steward,<br />
Meets with a maid of witching grace<br />
And dalliance ends in dire disgrace!<br />
In prison stripes you teach the fool<br />
That he must <i>love</i> by <i>human</i> rule!<br />
Yet you rear great, costly piles<br />
Where soiled doves may ply their wiles<br />
And lead to an unhallowed bed<br />
The lustful brute you lately wed.<br />
If passion will assert her power<br />
None shall dare a maid deflower<br />
Unless so <i>licensed</i> by the state<br />
In wedlock's bonds his lust to sate!<br />
And, if marriage prove a bane,<br />
<i>Divorce</i>, for cash, will ease his pain!<br />
Then to your haunts of sin he hies<br />
And laws of God and man defies<br />
By casting, in a barren sea,<br />
The germ of <i>life</i> that is to be!<br />
'Tis true this evil you decry&mdash;<br />
And raise your taxes mountain high!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>As if the more the state shall gain<br />
The less will virtue feel the strain!&mdash;<br />
You legalize <i>divorce</i> and <i>fraud</i>,<br />

Unmindful tho' he gain his wealth<br />
By open plunder or by stealth.<br />
In vain his hapless victims cry,<br />
His <i>gold</i> can legal silence buy!<br />
But if through stress of penury's strife<br />
One makes a shipwreck of his life,<br />
You prisons build and place within<br />
This fruitage of a law-made sin,<br />
To linger till the cowering slave<br />
Shall fill&mdash;unwept&mdash;a pauper's grave.<br />
And scarce a line of obscure print<br />

What wailings rend the astonished skies!<br />
What sabled hue and lengthened train<br />
Attest your deep regret and pain!<br />
How yon cathedral's vaulted arch<br />
Will echo with his funeral march;<br />
What flowers will deck his costly tomb;<br />
What tapers rob the grave of gloom;<br />
While columns, nay, whole papers tell<br />
How <i>great</i> a man today has fell.<br />
Deluded mortals! raise your eyes<br />

Where <i>justice</i> sits, each cause to try<br />
Beneath Omniscience's searching eye;<br />

Until each child of man should be,<br />
Like his dear self, from error free;<br />
All this they hear your idol tell&mdash;<br />

While heaven bows her head with awe<br />

While lash and pistol drives them on to hell;<br />
They crush his manhood and his soul debase,<br />
Blot out ambition and his name disgrace,<br />

Too oft repeated, who will dare to say<br />

<p class="p01">The darkness of Hades and a vile, deathly smell<br />
Is all that I feel stealing over my senses,</p>
<p class="p02">As lingering alone in this cold dungeon cell,<br />
Shut away from the world, where hearts' blood condenses.<br />
I feel 'tis too much for slight, trivial offenses.</p>

<p class="p01">Shut away from the dear ones, the loved ones on earth,<br />
I suffer the tortures that no man can tell</p>
<p class="p02">Till he's taken away from fireside and hearth<br />
And sees the sad visions of a dungeon cell&mdash;<br />
Then he feels that vile man can create a real hell.</p>

<p class="p01">As I sit here alone, my head throbbing and aching,<br />
And listen to hear if the keeper is near,</p>
<p class="p02">My thoughts they roam back to little ones taking<br />
Caresses so sweet from a mother so dear&mdash;<br />
Then I'm prompted to ask, "Do they think of me here?"</p>

<p class="p01">But when in my heart I feel a slight flutter,<br />
I know there is sympathy somewhere about;</p>
<p class="p02">I then to myself do silently mutter,<br />
"They have love for me still, and there is no doubt:"<br />
Aye, love for me still, and this I've found out.</p>

<p class="p01">Then, down on the damp and cold stony floor,<br />
Without either pillow, or blanket, or gown,</p>
<p class="p02">I stretch my weak body right close to the door,<br />
And there, in sweet sleep, my vision to drown&mdash;<br />
Then, when I awake, I'm not so cast down.</p>

<p class="p01">There is nothing so sweet and perfectly soothing<br />
To one who is placed in a cold dungeon cell,</p>
<p class="p02">As the thought that yet there are dear ones a-wooing<br />
The one who's imprisoned in a dark, dreary dell&mdash;<br />
I muttered, while sleeping, "'Tis well, ah, 'tis well."</p>

<p class="p01">Then, when I awoke and proceeded to think,<br />
Cold, stiffened and hungry, with tongue parched from thirst,</p>
<p class="p02">I seek but in vain for food and for drink,<br />
But bread and poor water, the same as at first&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Aye, dry bread and bad water, the same as at first.</p>

<p class="p01">Then my heart sank within me, so weak and so pale,<br />
As I gazed on the keeper of dungeon and jail</p>
<p class="p02">And begged for a drink of pure Adams' ale,<br />
As he held in his hand a full water pail&mdash;<br />
But the answer came back, "Your plea it must fail."</p>

<p class="p01">Then, giving it up in pure desperation,<br />
I try to surpass the curse of damnation</p>
<p class="p02">That springs to my lips ere I can but control<br />
The blood that is boiled by such torturing droll&mdash;<br />
Then I whisper, "Be still! Some one loves this poor soul."</p>

<p class="p01">Then, staid by the love of those dear ones at home,<br />
I steady myself and go swimming along;</p>
<p class="p01">I brave the hard life of a dark dungeon cell<br />
And I come out victorious, all perfect and well&mdash;<br />
Then I meet them again and go home there to dwell.</p>

<p class="p08">
Who knows how heavy his words may be,<br />
Or watches, when he has set them free,<br />
Their poising, their flight, their rise and fall<br />
In the world of thought? We are careless all.<br />
<br />
We fathom our own, not another's mind.<br />
And are all near-sighted among our kind,<br />
While words of ours and words of theirs<br />
Are meeting and wrestling unawares.<br />
<br />
Words are types of our moral trend,<br />
The blooms of our daily lives, that lend<br />
To others the fragrance of what we are&mdash;<br />
The outward semblance that goes afar.<br />
<br />
The part of ourselves that is not our own,<br />
When set afloat in the vast unknown,<br />
The something we give to the moving wheels<br />
Of the mighty force that grows and feels.<br />
<br />
No words are lost as they float away:<br />
On some life ever they rest and weigh,<br />
Unbound in public or depths obscure<br />
Their immortality is secure.<br />
<br />
Deep in our hearts we often find<br />
Words lips long closed have left behind:<br />
They live in the chambers of the brain,<br />
The source of endless joy or pain.<br />
<br />
Words may be soft as evening air<br />
Or fierce as sultry noonday's glare,<br />
But soft or fierce, be sure they rest<br />
A curse or blessing in some one's breast.<br />
<br />
How deep soever their meaning may lie,<br />
Not every soul will pass them by!<br />
No anger, nor passion, nor malice so great<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>But a match 'twill meet in a world of hate.<br />
<br />
No love so deep, no word so kind<br />
But lodges at last in a kindred mind,<br />
No thought so vast, nor high nor low<br />
But a parallel meets in a world of woe.<br />
<br />
A heedless word a heart may break,<br />
A thoughtful one a fortune make;<br />
One, hurl a soul in endless night;<br />
Another, lead to heaven's delight.<br />
<br />
One word may nerve a murderer's arm,<br />
Another still a raging storm&mdash;<br />
One, sow the seeds of endless strife;<br />
Another, sanctify a life.<br />
<br />
Our words outline the feeble tongue<br />
From which their outward being sprung,<br />
Or, written on the stainless page,<br />
They live to bless or curse an age.<br />
<br />
How careful, then, ought we to be<br />
Before we let such engines free!<br />
Once free, no power can call them back,<br />
Nor human genius trace their track.<br />
<br />
We loose them 'mid the wide expanse<br />
'Neath joyous spell or sorrow's trance,<br />
But if their fruitage all could know<br />
We would not deem them half so low.<br />

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="p08">
Two votaries of love's maddening dream<br />
At twilight sat beside a stream,<br />
Each painting scenes of future bliss,<br />
Dependent on their darling's kiss.<br />
<br />
Both were young and both were fair,<br />
With noble hearts and manly air,<br />
And both were members of a band<br />
Who bled to free his native land.<br />
<br />
Each was bound both heart and soul<br />
Beneath fair Nellie's sweet control,<br />
Yet they were friends both true and tried,<br />
If such ere lived, if such ere died.<br />
<br />
Each loved her much, yet neither knew<br />
How well each loved her, nor how true,<br />
For each was dreaming of the hour<br />
That <i>he</i> would cull this priceless flower.<br />
<br />
At last Ned turned and gayly said,<br />
"Next Wednesday I and Nellie wed&mdash;<br />
God knows I am the happiest man<br />
In all this joyous Western land.<br />
<br />
"I could not keep this back from you&mdash;<br />
That would be unjust&mdash;untrue.<br />
I feel whatever shall betide<br />
That <i>you</i> will e'er defend my bride."<br />
<br />
Harvey turned aside his face,<br />
Lest his friend should see some trace<br />
Of the anguish and despair<br />
The hopeless suffering mirrored there.<br />
<br />
Each word had sunk within his heart<br />
Like adder's tooth or poisoned dart;<br />
Joyful love and hope had fled,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>And left his withered heart&mdash;stone dead.<br />
<br />
He raised his haggard face above<br />
Until an angel mother's love<br />
Sent comfort to her suffering child,<br />
That made him calm and meek and mild.<br />
<br />
By memories of the tented field<br />
Where patriots died, but dared not yield,<br />
He knew that Ned his arm had lent<br />
To stop steel for his bosom meant,<br />
<br />
And oft had watched beside his bed<br />
When others in dismay had fled;<br />
When he spoke, his voice was low<br />
And soft as rippling streamlets flow:<br />
<br />
"I wish you peace and joy, Ned;<br />
You best deserve this queen to wed.<br />
I only crave in future life<br />
To serve you and your peerless wife."<br />
<br />
The loyal look in Harvey's eyes<br />
Was to Ned a new surprise;<br />
And in a moment all was plain&mdash;<br />
His friend's devotion and his pain.<br />
<br />
They stood and wrung each others hand<br />
To reinforce their friendship's band&mdash;<br />
Their hearts were full, their eyes were wet,<br />
Yet who can such a scene regret?<br />
<br />
Their friendship stood the cruel test,<br />
And sank triumphant into rest;<br />
They parted, but to meet again<br />
Where life was torture, memory pain.<br />
<br />
One year passed, and war had swept<br />
O'er the spot where these two wept,<br />
While they, with Meig's galland band,<br />
Were held by Santa Anna's hand.<br />
<br />
Behind Satillo's gloomy walls,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Whose history stoutest heart appalls,<br />
Here base deeds were hourly wrought<br />
With hell's intensest malice fraught.<br />
<br />
Two hundred patriots true and tried<br />
To Santa Anna's shame here died<br />
Simply because they leapt the wall<br />
And strove to go beyond recall!<br />
<br />
Ned and his comrades planned their flight<br />
While careless sentries slept at night,<br />
And in safety reached the distant plain<br />
Where hope and life revived again.<br />
<br />
Across the arid plain they sped,<br />
Half clothed, half starved and almost dead;<br />
Without a guide to lead them right<br />
They toiled by day and prayed by night.<br />
<br />
The blistering soil bold cactus bred<br />
Till every toil-worn foot was bled,<br />
And one by one the hapless band<br />
Fell prostrate on the glittering sand.<br />
<br />
Pursuing soldiers found them thus,<br />
And drug and drove them to the "truss,"<br />
There to await the "tortures grand"<br />
That Santa Anna would command.<br />
<br />
"Nine of ten shall now be shot;<br />
Choose the guilty dogs by lot:<br />
This law for ages now untold<br />
Has defied both fraud and gold!"<br />
<br />
<i>Nine black</i> beans and <i>one</i> snow <i>white</i><br />
Were placed within a box at night&mdash;<br />
Every captive must draw one,<br />
Blindfolded, ere the work begun.<br />
<br />
If <i>white</i>, he lived, if black, he died&mdash;<br />
Thus were the Texas patriots tried!<br />
By sons of Gantimozin's race&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Man's caricature and heaven's disgrace!<br />
<br />
Harvey drew one of faultless white,<br />
Ned drew one as black as night.<br />
"I'm lost&mdash;oh, God, my wife!" Ned gasped,<br />
As Harvey sprang his hand to clasp.<br />
<br />
"Not so," he cried, "your bean is white&mdash;<br />
See, mine is <i>black</i>, thank God! 'tis right!"<br />
E'er Ned could draw a conscious breath&mdash;<br />
Harvey had met a hero's death!<br />
<br />
Which loved her best, the man who <i>died</i><br />
Or he who <i>lived</i> to cheer his bride?<br />
Please answer me; O heart, awake&mdash;<br />
Such liberty I dare not take.<br />

That Mother's days may be days of joy,</p>
<p class="p02">And when she asks for me in prison<br />
Speak mildly of her convict boy.</p>

<p class="p01">"Here, take this to my dear old mother!<br />
I know 'tis but a lock of hair,</p>
<p class="p02">But it's all I've got to give her now&mdash;<br />
I know she'll treasure it with care."</p>

<p class="p01">And when he handed me the keepsake<br />
His spark of life had nearly fled.</p>
<p class="p02">He clenched my hand and uttered "<i>Mother!</i>"<br />
And a poor convict there lay dead.</p>

<p class="p01">May all young men now take fair warning<br />
From one who's had experience long:</p>
<p class="p02">Guard strong against temptation's dawning&mdash;<br />
Cast off evil and do no wrong.</p>

<p class="p01">In your younger days <i>court</i> good, <i>shun</i> evil;<br />
Be careful who you companions choose;</p>
<p class="p02">When you make life's start then do not cavil&mdash;<br />

<p class="pl0"><i>He</i> dwelt among you as a child of God,</p>
<p class="pl0">And in the path of honored wedlock trod.</p>
<p class="pl0"><i>You</i>, dead to nature and to nature's voice,</p>
<p class="pl0">Spurned woman and made man your choice!</p>
<p class="pl0">And desecrated, with your impious lust,</p>
<p class="pl0">The masterpiece God had formed from dust!</p>
<p class="pl0">Till woman, shorn of all her natural power,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Was cast aside, like some discarded flower,</p>
<p class="pl0">And stormed insulted heaven with hourly cry,</p>
<p class="pl0">Till God beheld you with His searching eye,</p>
<p class="pl0">And sent His angels in avenging haste</p>
<p class="pl0">Your sin to punish and your land to waste.</p>
<p class="pl0">The son of Horan met these at the gate,</p>
<p class="pl0">And begged them at his frugal board to wait;</p>
<p class="pl0">At first refused, they after turn aside,</p>
<p class="pl0">And 'neath a righteous roof content abide.</p>
<p class="pl0">They share his food and list with eager ear</p>
<p class="pl0">As Lot recounts each nightly scene of fear;</p>
<p class="pl0">When lust runs riot in the open streets,</p>
<p class="pl0">And man with man in strange communion meets.</p>
<p class="pl0">The men of Sodom learn, with kindling eye,</p>
<p class="pl0">The stranger's presence, and in haste draw nigh.</p>
<p class="pl0">Men, young and old, with equal ardor burn,</p>
<p class="pl0">And, with unholy lust, towards these strangers yearn.</p>
<p class="pl0">They call the patriarch with an angry shout,</p>
<p class="pl0">And bid him bring the hallowed strangers out,</p>
<p class="pl0">That they may satisfy their lawless lust</p>
<p class="pl0">And trample decency in sinful dust.</p>
<p class="pl0">He, taught from infancy in Mosaic Law,</p>
<p class="pl0">Regarded heaven's High Ruler still with awe;</p>
<p class="pl0">And shuddered with indignant fear</p>
<p class="pl0">As these vile shouts assailed his ear.</p>
<p class="pl0">He left his house and closed the door behind,</p>
<p class="pl0">And to the rabble thus he eased his mind:</p>
<p class="pl0">"Ye men of Sodom! <i>once</i> in life do right,</p>
<p class="pl0">Nor do this wickedness in heaven's sight!</p>
<p class="pl0">Two virgin daughters 'neath my roof reside,</p>
<p class="pl0">Till now a father's care and mother's pride;</p>
<p class="pl0">Take them and do whatever you deem right,</p>
<p class="pl0">But lay no impious hand upon my guests tonight.</p>
<p class="pl0">The laws of hospitality, by Moses taught,</p>
<p class="pl0">Harms not a stranger whom our roof has sought.</p>
<p class="pl0">They know the law, who now reside within,</p>
<p class="pl0">And with horror view your awful sin!"</p>
<p class="pl0">"Ye men of Sodom! who this stranger gave</p>
<p class="pl0">The right to judge us and our will to brave?</p>
<p class="pl0">We kindly took a homeless wanderer in,</p>
<p class="pl0">And dare he brand our greatest pleasure sin?</p>
<p class="pl0">Shall empty words defy our proud behest,</p>
<p class="pl0">Or useless offering prevent our guest?</p>
<p class="pl0">Ten thousand 'No's' will pierce his dastard breast,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>And treat him tenfold worse than all the rest!"</p>
<p class="pl0">Thus spake their leader, and with angry roar</p>
<p class="pl0">The o'er wrought friends assail the door;</p>
<p class="pl0">Lot, backward hurled, could hardly stand,</p>
<p class="pl0">Till snatched within by angel hand,</p>
<p class="pl0">The maddened crowd no longer wait,</p>
<p class="pl0">But headlong rush to meet their fate!</p>
<p class="pl0">The ready angels rise, with godlike mind,</p>
<p class="pl0">And strike the guilty wretches blind:</p>
<p class="pl0">In vain they strive to reach and force the door,</p>
<p class="pl0">Their useless orbs are blasted evermore!</p>
<p class="pl0">"Go seek thy children, Lot, in eager haste,</p>
<p class="pl0">And bid them not a precious moment waste.</p>
<p class="pl0">God will destroy this sin-accursed place,</p>
<p class="pl0">And wipe from earth its faintest trace!"</p>
<p class="pl0">Lot, thus commanded, found each one that night,</p>
<p class="pl0">And faithfully portrayed their awful plight;</p>
<p class="pl0">But he, to them, seemed as a man that mocked,</p>
<p class="pl0">And left them sorely grieved and doubly shocked.</p>
<p class="pl0">The morn arose! The angels cautioned Lot</p>
<p class="pl0">To wife and daughters take and tarry not;</p>
<p class="pl0">And as they lingered took them by the hand</p>
<p class="pl0">And led them from the endangered land.</p>
<p class="pl0">"Flee to the mountains and no hind'rance brook,</p>
<p class="pl0">Nor backward turn a long, admiring look.</p>
<p class="pl0">The wretch who dares this mandate to defy</p>
<p class="pl0">Shall, 'neath Jehovah's hand, in torture die!"</p>
<p class="pl0">This stern command was heard by trembling Lot</p>
<p class="pl0">With deep repugnance, for it pleased him not.</p>
<p class="pl0">"Nay, nay, my lord; but if before thy face</p>
<p class="pl0">Thy trembling servant dares to plead for grace,</p>
<p class="pl0">Command me that I now may turn aside</p>
<p class="pl0">And in your little city safe reside.</p>
<p class="pl0">Thus may I keep my soul alive this day</p>
<p class="pl0">Nor after fall to mountain beasts a prey."</p>
<p class="pl0">The heavenly strangers, with an august nod,</p>
<p class="pl0">Agree to lift from Zoar Jehovah's rod.</p>
<p class="pl0">The rescued quartette Zoarward bend,</p>
<p class="pl0">While hope and fear alternate tend.</p>
<p class="pl0">With mien majestic, yes, with hasty tread,</p>
<p class="pl0">Their trembling flight their aged father led.</p>
<p class="pl0">Next came the virgins, able scarce to stand,</p>
<p class="pl0">And followed by their mother, last of all the band.</p>
<p class="pl0">She yet to Sodom and its idols clave,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>And dared Jehovah's awful wrath to brave;</p>
<p class="pl0">One look she sought, her weary journey to beguile,</p>
<p class="pl0">And in a moment stood transfixed&mdash;<i>a Salty Pile!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">The more obedient trio onward fly,</p>
<p class="pl0">Until the opening gates of Zoar greet the eye.</p>
<p class="pl0">Now, with full hearts, they reach the calm retreat,</p>
<p class="pl0">And cordial welcome from King Bela meet.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><i>A TRIBUTE TO<br /><span class="small">THE WOLFE SISTERS.</span></i></h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="p01">Music, the sweetest all-inspiring gift of God.<br />
Is ever welcome to the prisoner's ear;</p>
<p class="p02">There's nothing makes me feel half so well<br />
As music of the heart when sung with cheer.</p>

<p class="p01">Here in this prison as I sit and pore<br />
Over the past and present of my life,</p>
<p class="p02">My heart sings ever, o'er and o'er,<br />
The darkest bitterness of a prisoner's strife.</p>

<p class="p01">But hark! in yonder chapel shrine<br />
I hear sweet music as of yore;</p>
<p class="p02">I ask, "What music is that sounds so fine?"<br />
The answer comes, "The Wolfes are at the door!"</p>

<p class="pn">I hasten, then, to brush my prison garb,<br />
And toilet try to fix as best I can,<br />
And then unto the chapel wend my way;<br />
When there upon the rostrum stand</p>
<p class="p09"><i>Five of the sweetest singers of our day!</i></p>

<p class="pl1">There's Amy Wolfe, who changed her name to Brooks;</p>
<p class="pl0">She leads her choir without the aid of books.</p>
<p class="pl0">She sings with voice so sweet and delicate</p>
<p class="pl0">That to her, First Soprano I dedicate.</p>

<p class="pl1">Next, Minnie S., at the age of twenty-three,</p>
<p class="pl0">Sings like a lark and busy as a bee,</p>
<p class="pl0">Carefully guarding that no mistakes are made,</p>
<p class="pl0">And handles her bewitching voice with harmony well staid.</p>

<p class="pl1">Then sang the sweet Zoraydo F., with baritone most clear,</p>
<p class="pl0">Who, at the age of twenty, delights to bring us cheer.</p>
<p class="pl0">It seems as if her heart and soul were bent on doing right,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>And when she sang she sang so sweet&mdash;Oh! it was out of sight.</p>

<p class="pl1">The next I saw was Lyda M., with scarlet cheeks aglow;</p>
<p class="pl0">She sings with voice most charming, a clear and sweet alto,</p>
<p class="pl0">She's next the younger of them all, because she's just eighteen,</p>
<p class="pl0">She captivates the heart of man&mdash;what a fairy little Queen!</p>

<p class="pl1">Then last, not least, the little one, that is, Miss Kittie C.,</p>
<p class="pl0">She just so busy when she sings she's like a honey bee.</p>
<p class="pl0">Her eyes are clear as crystal, her locks are flowing gold,</p>
<p class="pl0">She sings soprano quite as fine as any I have told.</p>

<p class="pl1">I sat down in an empty seat close by the outside door,</p>
<p class="pl0">And listened to such warbling as I never heard before.</p>
<p class="pl0">Their voices drowned all sorrow and gushed forth many a tear,</p>
<p class="pl0"><i>Not</i> for horror that I felt&mdash;it brought me real good cheer.</p>

<p class="pl0">They drove away the pain of woe, that none but prisoners smart;</p>
<p class="pl0">They sang the ever blessed song&mdash;true music of the heart.</p>
<p class="pl0">We doff our striped caps to you, O girls of sweetest song,</p>
<p class="pl0">And may we bid you be our friends and return again ere long.</p>

<p class="pl1">Adieu, adieu, our lady friends, do not now say "farewell,"</p>
<p class="pl0">Because we wish you all return with song too sweet to tell.</p>
<p class="pl0">Come back! come back again and sing some lovely Sabbath day,</p>
<p class="pl0">For your presence here to sing good cheer we all will ever pray.</p>

<p class="pl1">And now unto the aged Wolfes please let me say one word:</p>
<p class="pl0">Your home must be a palace filled with sirenic good;</p>
<p class="pl0">Proud may you feel&mdash;and justly, too&mdash;of these five daughters fair,</p>
<p class="pl0">And great the good they've done for us while in this prison lair.</p>

<p class="pl1">There's but one wish that emanates from a prisoner's wicked heart.</p>
<p class="pl0">That is to say, without delay, "May heaven take their part,</p>
<p class="pl0">And to them bring eternal joy that'll pierce them like a dart!"</p>
<p class="pl0">Each song they sing is welcome here&mdash;a masterpiece of art!</p>

<p class="pl1">And now to part we sadly must (while I'm immersed in prison dust).</p>
<p class="pl0">But hoping, too, 'twill not be long ere you return with sweetest song. Adieu! Adieu!</p>

<hr class="dec2" />

<p class="pn center">BY GEO. W. H. HARRISON.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="p05">I wrote a letter while jealous rage<br />
In my bosom reigned supreme;</p>
<p class="p06">The words were fraught with anger,<br />
And a loathsome disesteem.</p>

<p class="p05">They fell on the pure white paper<br />
And marred its stainless page,</p>
<p class="p06">Yet eased my maddened spirit,<br />
And appeased my senseless rage.</p>

<p class="p05">I gloatingly tho't of the dumb despair<br />
That letter would surely give,</p>
<p class="p06">To one who had broken her faithful vows<br />
In a way I could never forgive.</p>

<p class="p05">I doubted not the perfect truth<br />
Of all I heard them say;</p>
<p class="p06">She, like other girls, was false<br />
While her lover was away.</p>

<p class="p05">I knew she vowed she would be true<br />
While life itself would last,</p>
<p class="p06">Yet thought that she, like others,<br />
Too soon forgot the past.</p>

<p class="p05">I hastily sealed the cruel note,<br />
And placed it next my heart,</p>
<p class="p06">Determined upon the morrow<br />
To give it an early start.</p>

<p class="p05">I threw myself upon the couch<br />
And sought for sweet repose,</p>
<p class="p06">And in my restless slumbers<br />
A vision then arose:</p>

<p class="p05">I saw in that terrible vision<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>A woman whose eager face</p>
<p class="p06">Beamed with yearning, restless love<br />
As her trembling fingers traced</p>

<p class="p05">A message of love and tenderness<br />
To her loved one far away.</p>
<p class="p06">As her pure lips quietly murmured,<br />
"God grant we must some day!"</p>

<p class="p05">She sealed her letter with dainty hands,<br />
And laid it by with tender care:</p>
<p class="p06">Then humbly kneeled beside her bed,<br />
And poured her soul in prayer.</p>

<p class="p05">She prayed for her impassioned lover<br />
In a warm, impassioned strain,</p>
<p class="p06">That proved her heart both warm and true<br />
And free from guilt or stain.</p>

<p class="p05">She arose from her kneeling posture<br />
To answer a call at her door:</p>
<p class="p06">She smiled as she saw the letter<br />
The hand of the servant bore.</p>

<p class="p05">One glance she gave&mdash;then burst the seal<br />
With trembling, eager haste,</p>
<p class="p06">And rapidly heard the cruel words<br />
My reckless hand had traced.</p>

<p class="p05">Her lovely face turned deathly pale<br />
As she wildly clutched the air.</p>
<p class="p06">She tottered and fell&mdash;a senseless heap&mdash;<br />
A prey to dumb despair.</p>

<p class="p05">So still she lay I deemed her dead,<br />
And sprang to raise her in my arms.</p>
<p class="p06">I loved her with the old, wild love,<br />
And bowed to her peerless charms.</p>

<p class="p05">"Speak! darling, speak!" I wildly cried.<br />
"Pray, come back from the voiceless shore.</p>
<p class="p06">I cannot, dare not live an hour,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Unless I hear your voice once more!"</p>

<p class="p05">She opened wide her lovely eyes,<br />
And cast on me one lingering glance</p>
<p class="p06">So full of injured innocence<br />
It smote me like a lance.</p>

<p class="p05">I seized the heartless letter,<br />
Curst cause of all my shame,</p>
<p class="p06">And, with one imprecation,<br />
Consigned it to the flame.</p>

<p class="p05">She watched me with a languid smile,<br />
And pointed to her heart:</p>
<p class="p06">"You have destroyed the proof," she said,<br />
"But can you ease the smart?"</p>

<p class="p05">"I have been true to all my vows,<br />
Heaven judge me if I lie!</p>
<p class="p06">But since you deem me to be false,<br />
Go&mdash;leave me here&mdash;to die!"</p>

<p class="p05">At last I woke and quickly drew<br />
The accursed sheet from my breast&mdash;</p>
<p class="p06">Burning it with a ready hand&mdash;<br />
And gently sank to rest.</p>

<p class="p05">I wrote another, whose tender words<br />
Were soft as the ripple of a stream;</p>
<p class="p06">And thought what a contrast it would be<br />
To the letter she read in my dream!</p>

<p class="p05">And my darling greatly wonders<br />
Why my letters with tenderness teem,</p>
<p class="p06">Since I have never told her<br />
Of the letter she read in my dream.</p>

<p class="p03">Oh, God in heaven up on high,<br />
How long this cruel strife?<br />
Most I but perish in this den<br />
To end this wretched life?<br />
Is there no justice here on earth?<br />
Must truth remain crushed down<br />
And vile and wicked, cruel man<br />
Forever look and frown?<br />
Is there no power to bring to light<br />
The <i>truth</i> of my offense?<br />
Must perjury and bribery<br />
Prevail forever hence?<br />
Can enemies, vile, cruel things,<br />
Twist truth all out of shape,<br />

To morally wear death's crepe?<br />
Oh, God! is there no remedy<br />
For earthly subjects thus<br />
To be relieved from wretched pain<br />
Without this earthly fuss?<br />
Oh, God! to Thee we call for help.<br />
Wil't thou but listen&mdash;hear?<br />
Look down upon me as I be,<br />
My innocence thou'lt surely see,<br />
These shackles, bolts, and prison bars,<br />
The heavy locks and massive key&mdash;<br />
Hear, Oh, God! Oh, hear my prayer<br />
And set this captive free.</p>

<p class="p05">Just sixty years ago today<br />
Mine eyes first saw the light;</p>
<p class="p06">Now age, with ever onward tread,<br />
Presages coming night.</p>

<p class="p05">Ah! is it night? Or shall it be<br />
That morning's light shall break,</p>
<p class="p06">And from my soul such music bring<br />
As earth could never wake?</p>

<p class="p05">Where are the friends of earlier years&mdash;<br />
Sleep they to wake no more?</p>
<p class="p06">Or do they walk with joyful tread<br />
Heaven's ever radiant shore?</p>

<p class="p05">If death is but oblivion's gate,<br />
Why younger grows the soul with years?</p>
<p class="p06">Whose are the faces that we see<br />
When melts the hearts in tears?</p>

<p class="p05">Oh, whence the strains the soul can hear<br />
When all is hushed in sleep,</p>
<p class="p06">And none, save God and angels, near<br />
When souls their vigils keep?</p>

<p class="p05">Is all religion but a myth?<br />
Are all our hopes in vain?</p>
<p class="p06">Is heaven affectation's child,<br />
Born of disordered brain?</p>

<p class="p05">Tell me not such bolts and bars<br />
Can keep me from the skies;</p>

<p class="pl1">Come. O come, ye radiant sisters, heaven honored "Tuneful Nine."</p>
<p class="pl0">Smooth my ever rugged numbers and inspire my drooping line.</p>
<p class="pl0">Aid my muse to tell the story never breathed to mortal ear.</p>
<p class="pl0">How this sweet angelic chorus happens to be lingering near.</p>
<p class="pl0">In yon fair and blissful aiden, far beyond the faintest star.</p>
<p class="pl0">Once the guardian angels slumbered, leaving heaven's gates ajar!</p>
<p class="pl0">And five wandering seraphs wandered, in their rapid, noiseless flight,</p>
<p class="pl0">Thro' the gates, whose vaulted arches echoed pæans of delight!</p>
<p class="pl0">Quick as thought their tireless pinions clave the unresisting air.</p>
<p class="pl0">Till they reached the <i>five Wolfe sisters</i>, maids of form and features fair,</p>
<p class="pl0">And within these hearts they lingered, tuning every chord to song.</p>
<p class="pl0">Till the pathos of their music stilled the ever restless throng!</p>
<p class="pl0">Earth and heaven stood astonished and Jehovah's love decreed:</p>
<p class="pl0">"Let them stay! such strains seraphic mortal beings can but heed!"</p>

<p class="pl1">Have you heard their wondrous music? Have you felt their sweet control?</p>
<p class="pl0">If not, friend, you've scarcely sounded half the mysteries of your soul!</p>
<p class="pl0">Amy, soul-enrapturing artist, sweetly sounds the soft prelude.</p>
<p class="pl0">And beneath her skilfull fingers every note, with life imbued.</p>
<p class="pl0">Stills the throng, whose very silence is an encore loud and deep.</p>
<p class="pl0">And each thought, save that of music, is forgotten or asleep.</p>
<p class="pl0">Katherine's rich and  full suprano, like the Autumn's mellow morn.</p>
<p class="pl0">Wakes the slumbering soul to action like the practiced huntsman's horn!</p>
<p class="pl0">Mamie's soft, melodious voice nobly takes the second part.</p>
<p class="pl0">And the pathos of her music captivates the raptured heart!</p>
<p class="pl0">Lida's faultless second alto deepens all the noble strain</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Till the mind forgets its madness and the heart rejects in pain.</p>
<p class="pl0">Then Zoraydo's matchless voice sweeps the soul along</p>
<p class="pl0">Till we know that <i>perfect music can be breathed in earthly song!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Hear, O hear the melting music pouring from each heaving breast;</p>
<p class="pl0">How it wakes the heart to rapture! How it soothes the soul to rest!</p>

<p class="pl1">When they sing, such lovely visions seem to rise and grandly float</p>
<p class="pl0">Like the poet's airy mansions, on the wave of each full note!</p>
<p class="pl0">Silvery daybreaks brighten slow; sunsets blush on mountain snow!</p>
<p class="pl0">Moonlight shivers on the open sea; Autumn burns in bush and tree;</p>
<p class="pl0">Blowing willows bend and sigh; whispering rivers wander by;</p>
<p class="pl0">Thro' the pines sweep sea-tones soft; sailing birds shout loud aloft;</p>
<p class="pl0">Strange notes beat the lambent air; visions float divinely fair;</p>
<p class="pl0">Vanished faces come and go; silenced voices murmur low;</p>
<p class="pl0">Gentlest memories come and cling, <i>as we listen and they sing</i>.</p>

<p class="pl1">Oh, repeat the music's tale, "<i>Love shall perish not nor fail!</i>"</p>
<p class="pl0">We forget the fear of death&mdash;breathe, in tho't, immortal breath!</p>
<p class="pl0">We believe in broadening truth; trust the generous creeds of youth;</p>
<p class="pl0">Feel consoling hopes that climb up to some triumphant clime,</p>
<p class="pl0">And sweet dreams of splendor bring <i>as we listen and they sing!</i></p>

<p class="pl1">Walls of rock and bars of steel we can neither see nor feel;</p>
<p class="pl0">We forget our dire disgrace; disregard both time and place;</p>
<p class="pl0">Bid all angry passion sleep and profoundest silence keep!</p>
<p class="pl0">Hoard the trembling notes that fall like an angel mother's call;</p>
<p class="pl0">Rise above our low estate and forget the wrongs of fate!</p>
<p class="pl0">We forgive our mortal foes, source of all our many woes,</p>
<p class="pl0">And penance itself loses half its sting, <i>as we listen and they sing!</i></p>

<p class="pl1">May the God of love and truth give them all the joys of youth;</p>
<p class="pl0">May the raptures they impart ever thrill each noble heart;</p>
<p class="pl0">May their ministry of love lead all erring ones above;</p>
<p class="pl0">May wealth, happiness and joy all their waiting hours employ;</p>
<p class="pl0">Be their cares both light and few and their pleasures ever new;</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>And their lives one dream of ease till their "ship comes o'er the seas!"</p>
<p class="pl0">Let fate oft their presence bring, <i>and we'll listen while they sing</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Gentle sisters, take this tribute poured from imprisoned hearts;</p>
<p class="pl0">You have eased their maddening torture, you have stayed the cruel darts</p>
<p class="pl0">That remorse and shame have driven deep within each captive soul.</p>
<p class="pl0">Suffer them your names to graven on fond memory's deathless scroll:</p>
<p class="pl0">Be assured your seeds of kindness shall not fall on stony ground,</p>
<p class="pl0">Many of  your willing converts have both peace and pardon found!</p>
<p class="pl0">And, when all your work is ended, you in heaven shall fondly greet</p>
<p class="pl0">Some whose hearts were first enlightened by your anthems clear and sweet.</p>

Into the solemn gulf that covers all.</p>

<p class="p01">But <i>thou</i> hast gone. Gone from this dreary land;<br />
Gone from the storms let loose on every hill;</p>
<p class="p02">Lured by the sweet persuasion of a band<br />
That leads thee, somewhere, in the distance still.</p>

<p class="p01">Where e'er thou art, I know thou wearest yet<br />
The same bewitching beauty, sanctified</p>
<p class="p02">By calmer joy, and touched with soft regret<br />
For him who seeks but cannot reach thy side.</p>

<p class="p01">I keep for thee the living love of old,<br />
And seek thy place in nature, as a child</p>
<p class="p02">Whose hand is parted from its playmate's hold<br />
Wanders and cries along a lonesome wild.</p>

<p class="p01">When, in the watches of my heart, I hear<br />
The messages of purer life and know</p>
<p class="p02">The footsteps of thy spirit lingering near,<br />
Life's darkness hides the way I fain would go.</p>

<p class="p01">Canst thou not bid the empty realms restore<br />
That form, the symbol of thy heavenly part?</p>
<p class="p02">Or in the barren fields of silence pour<br />
That voice, the perfect music of thy heart?</p>

<p class="p01">Oh, once&mdash;once bending to my warm and eager lips,<br />
Take back the tender warmth of life from me,</p>
<p class="p02">Or let thy kisses cloud with swift eclipse<br />
The light of mine, and give me death with thee.</p>

<p class="p05">'Tis midnight in these prison walls,<br />
And even the sentry's muffled tread</p>
<p class="p06">Sepulchral sounds, as if he trod<br />
The silent confines of the dead.</p>

<p class="p05">In vain I close my weary eyes,<br />
I cannot sleep tonight;</p>
<p class="p06">I hear an angel's rustling wings<br />
Fresh from the realms of light.</p>

<p class="p05">A sacred presence haunts the air,<br />
A messenger from Heaven's own land;</p>
<p class="p06">And memory awakes again,<br />
Touched by an angel's wand.</p>

<p class="p05">I seem to hear, deep in my soul,<br />
The music of a heavenly choir,</p>
<p class="p06">While each pulsation of my heart<br />
Awakes in me the old desire</p>

<p class="p05">To see once more that lovely form<br />
Death vanished in my arms;</p>
<p class="p06">To hear again her melting voice<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>And revel in her charms.</p>

<p class="p05">To feel the tender, soft caress<br />
Of a loved tho' vanished hand,</p>
<p class="p06">And hear from her departed lips<br />
The mysteries of that land</p>

<p class="p05">That lies beyond Time's rugged shore,<br />
To all unknown, save those</p>
<p class="p06">Whom angels capture for the skies<br />
At life's uncertain close.</p>

<p class="p05">I muse again, with loving thought,<br />
Of a sinless wife long dead,</p>
<p class="p06">And live again our buried past,<br />
By an angel presence led.</p>

<p class="p05">I view again the pleasing scene<br />
Of a school house on the hill,</p>
<p class="p06">Where happy scholars daily met,<br />
Whose law was the teacher's will.</p>

<p class="p05">I see again the old armchair<br />
Where the Master daily sat</p>
<p class="p06">With watchful eye and helpful hand,<br />
Yet sleepless as a cat.</p>

<p class="p05">I hear again the sleepless hum<br />
Of voices low and sweet,</p>
<p class="p06">Of students pouring o'er the books<br />
With wisdom's germs replete.</p>

<p class="p05">Amid that happy, guileless throng,<br />
There was one peerless face</p>
<p class="p06">That held in the Master's tender heart<br />
An undisputed place.</p>

<p class="p05">It was a face, O God! how fair!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>No words can ever paint;</p>
<p class="p06">More fit for heaven than for earth.<br />
It bore the contour of a saint.</p>

<p class="p05">The brow was high and broad and white,<br />
With a radiance all its own;</p>
<p class="p06">The cheeks, like lilies dipped in blood,<br />
Were oft as a rose full blown.</p>

<p class="p05">Eyebrows dark and delicately arched,<br />
Were penciled in Nature's play;</p>
<p class="p06">The ruby ripeness of her lips<br />
Seemed never to melt away.</p>

<p class="p05">Her lustrous eyes, whose depths were brown,<br />
Yet seemed a darker hue,</p>
<p class="p06">Were windows of a spotless soul<br />
That scorned to be untrue.</p>

<p class="p05">Abundant tresses of dark brown hair<br />
That almost swept the ground,</p>
<p class="p06">Enveloped as chaste and lovely form<br />
As e'er on earth was found.</p>

<p class="p05">A voice so soft, so sweet, so low<br />
That every accent woke</p>
<p class="p06">Sweet notes of blissful melody,<br />
As if an angel spoke.</p>

<p class="p05">None could look upon that face<br />
And deem that aught of earth</p>
<p class="p06">Could chill the rapture of a soul<br />
Where sin could know no birth.</p>

<p class="p05">Her mind had wondrous power and scope;<br />
It grasped the sea, the earth, the sky,</p>
<p class="p06">And rightly understood and loved<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>The God who ruled on high.</p>

<p class="p05">Contentment, truth and virtue<br />
Was part of Nature's dower;</p>
<p class="p06">Self-sacrifice to her was joy,<br />
And prayer was conscious power.</p>

<p class="p05">While yet a child her spirit soared<br />
Above the things of earth,</p>
<p class="p06">And mused with soulful tenderness<br />
On the heaven that gave it birth.</p>

<p class="p05">The teacher's stern, imperious heart<br />
Yearningly worshipped this child,</p>
<p class="p06">And 'neath her hallowed influence<br />
Grew tender, warm and mild.</p>

<p class="p05">The haughty heart, that never sought<br />
The plaudits of the world,</p>
<p class="p06">Poured its richest tribute<br />
At the feet of this faultless girl.</p>

<p class="p05">The face, that never even blanched<br />
'mid war's terrific strife,</p>
<p class="p06">Grew pale as death the hour he asked<br />
This child to be his wife.</p>

<p class="p05">No word she spake, but simply laid<br />
Her head upon his breast.</p>
<p class="p06">He folded her in warm embrace<br />
And knew that he was blest.</p>

<p class="p05">Each lived a life of conscious joy;<br />
Earth seemed a garden fair;</p>
<p class="p06">The lover sought earth's fairest flowers<br />
To braid in her shining hair.</p>

<p class="p05">Deeply they drank at the font of love;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Draughts few natures can hold;</p>
<p class="p06">The hours were seasons of perfect bliss;<br />
Each moment more precious than gold.</p>

<p class="p05">Days and months flew swiftly by<br />
On the wings of happiness sped,</p>
<p class="p06">And two sweet babes were garnered<br />
As the fruit of their marriage bed!</p>

<p class="p05">They neither thought nor dreamed of aught<br />
Save their babes and coming bliss;</p>
<p class="p06">They greeted the morn with soft caress<br />
And welcomed night with a kiss.</p>

<p class="p05">Till, thundering on the wings of Time,<br />
Fate dealt the cruel blow</p>
<p class="p06">That dashed a home in pieces<br />
And laid a child-wife low.</p>

<p class="p05">The husband pressed her to his breast<br />
And fondly kissed his bride;</p>
<p class="p06">But with the parting of that kiss<br />
The sinless child-wife died.</p>

<p class="p05">The kindred angels joyful flew<br />
From the realms of endless day,</p>
<p class="p06">And gently wafted her soul above,<br />
But left to us her clay.</p>

<p class="p05">"She is dead! Kiss her and come away.<br />
Your cries and prayers are all in vain,</p>
<p class="p06">Your May-Bell is cold, senseless clay;<br />
In heaven above you'll meet again."</p>

<p class="p05">They smoothed her tresses of dark brown hair<br />
Back from her marble forehead fair;</p>
<p class="p06">Over her eyes, that oped too much,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>They closed the lids with a tender touch.</p>

<p class="p05">They closed with tender touch, that day,<br />
The thin, pale lips where beauty lay;</p>
<p class="p06">About her brow and her sweet pale face<br />
They tied her veil and bridal lace;</p>

<p class="p05">Placed on her feet the white silk shoes<br />
That May-Bell for her marriage chose;</p>
<p class="p06">Over her bosom crossed her hands;<br />
"Come away," they said, "God understands."</p>

<p class="p05">With bowed heads they left the room,<br />
Still shuddering at its silent gloom;</p>
<p class="p06">And naught, save silence, lingered there<br />
Around the corpse of May-Bell Clare.</p>

<p class="p05">But I loved her far too well to dread<br />
The silent, stately, beautiful dead.</p>
<p class="p06">I cautiously opened the chamber door<br />
And was alone with my dead once more.</p>

<p class="p05">I kissed her lips, I kissed her cheek,<br />
But 'twas in vain, she could not speak.</p>
<p class="p06">I called her names, she loved, awhile,<br />
But she was dead and could not smile.</p>

<p class="p05">And not one passionate whisper of love<br />
Could call her back from her home above.</p>
<p class="p06">"Cold lips," I murmured, "breast without breath,<br />
Is there no voice, no language in death?"</p>

<p class="p05">Dull to ear and still to the sense,<br />
Yet to the soul of love intense!</p>
<p class="p06">See, I listen with soul, not ear;<br />
What is the secret of dying, my dear?</p>

When earth-sundered ones in glory shall meet.</p>

Without one sympathetic tone&mdash;</p>

<p class="p05">One glance of love, one word of cheer<br />
From eyes and lips I hold so dear?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Beloved one, and forsake the skies!</p>

<p class="p05">Oh, listen! Earth-born mortals, see!<br />
My angel bride has come to me!</p>
<p class="p06">The self-same face&mdash;divinely fair&mdash;<br />
And heaven-set jewels decked her hair.</p>

<p class="p05">Her laughing eye and glowing cheek<br />
Eternal youth and bliss bespeak;</p>

<p class="p06">She folds me 'neath her dazzling wings,<br />
While all the heart within me sings!</p>

<p class="p05">Oh, list those melting tones of love,<br />
More soft than note of cooing dove!</p>
<p class="p06">Oh, hear the words her dear lips speak:<br />
"Death, dear one, is the boon to seek!</p>

<p class="p05">"False are the glittering gems of earth,<br />
Eternity's gold is the gold of worth;</p>
<p class="p06">One moment in heaven is worth a life<br />
Spent on earth 'mid care and strife!</p>

<p class="p05">"Death is but the dawn of day,<br />
Destroying naught save worthless clay!</p>
<p class="p06">The soul lives on in rapturous bliss<br />
More perfect than a virgin kiss!</p>

<p class="p05">"Oh, dear one, still your haunting fears;<br />
The love, tho' lost, of earlier years</p>
<p class="p06">Awaits your coming to the skies,<br />
And o'er you watch with jealous eyes,</p>

<p class="p05">"Lest earth detain you till too late<br />

<p class="p06">Oh, tarry not on earth too long,<br />
But with me join immortal's song!"</p>

<p class="p05">She spake, and through the vaulted sky,<br />
Beyond the reach of mortal eye,</p>
<p class="p06">She wings her rapid noiseless flight<br />
And I am left alone tonight.</p>

<p class="p05">Nay, not alone; for in my soul<br />
I feel a new-born sweet control</p>
<p class="p06">That lures me to a higher life,<br />
Which will please an angel wife!</p>

<p class="p05">Farewell, prison blight and bars,<br />
Mine is a home beyond the stars.</p>
<p class="p06">Welcome, Death, at any hour,<br />
Since sin has lost her maddening power!</p>

In this America.</p>

<p class="p05">The Waddington's were pure Scotch blood,<br />
And raised one daughter fair;</p>
<p class="p06">They gave her name of Sadie,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>She'd blue eyes and golden hair.</p>

<p class="p05">Her cheeks were rich with crimson glow,<br />
Her lips were thin and cute,</p>
<p class="p06">And many an anxious lover<br />
She sternly did refute.</p>

<p class="p05">Her dainty hands and flowing hair,<br />
And graceful curves of form</p>
<p class="p06">Would make one's heart quite palpitate&mdash;<br />
She carried all by storm.</p>

<p class="p05">Trueman Waddington was a man<br />
Who loved his daughter&mdash;heir,</p>
<p class="p06">And as he rolled in endless wealth<br />
He watched his child's welfare.</p>

<p class="p05">Their nearest neighbor was St. Lawrence,<br />
Who lived a little way</p>
<p class="p06">Off on the rugged mountain side,<br />
Where children like to play.</p>

<p class="p05">Two children he had buried<br />
When they were yet quite young,</p>
<p class="p06">And now he was a happy man<br />
'Cause he reared an only son.</p>

<p class="p05">This son he named him Trueman,<br />
Because he liked the name,</p>
<p class="p06">And tho't 'twould be in honor<br />
Of his neighbor of the same.</p>

<p class="p05">"As an act of kindness and of love,"<br />
Old Waddington did say,</p>
<p class="p06">"Because you named him after me<br />
I pledge my Sade, today."</p>

<p class="p05">The two old friends called in their wives<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>And asked them to consent</p>
<p class="p06">To seal the bargain for each child<br />
On which they were both bent.</p>

<p class="p05">The mothers thought it rather soon<br />
To tie so firm a knot,</p>
<p class="p06">And begged them not to seal their doom<br />
By such a foolish plot.</p>

<p class="p05">But Trueman Waddington was not<br />
A man to easy quit,</p>
<p class="p06">And he argued long and labored strong<br />
In a half way frenzied fit.</p>

<p class="p05">He said: "I know we are both rich<br />
In lands and kine and gold,</p>
<p class="p06">And why not join these vast fortunes<br />
Before they are all sold?</p>

<p class="p05">"You've named your only son from me;<br />
Trueman it is, <i>True-Man</i> he'll be,</p>
<p class="p06">And now must I sit by in shame<br />
And cannot seal my daughter's fame?"</p>

<p class="p05">Then spake the elder man St. Lawrence:<br />
"Dear sir, my neighbor and my friend,</p>
<p class="p06">You have my heart and soul and mind,<br />
And these vast fortunes I will bind</p>

<p class="p05">"Together with true chords of love.<br />
God help our children find</p>
<p class="p06">A part their mothers will not take<br />
In this, to seal their children's fate.</p>

<p class="p05">"Now let me, please, suggest a way<br />
To reach this matter of today;</p>
<p class="p06">And we will friendly make the deal<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>So lawyers cannot break the seal."</p>

<p class="p05">Then Waddington sprang to his feet,<br />
And warmly did his neighbors greet;</p>
<p class="p06">Then shook him warmly by the hand,<br />
And said, "Come, let us seal the band."</p>

<p class="p05">And then with fixed and mellow eye<br />
He gazed on high as he stood by</p>
<p class="p06">His rugged friend and neighbor, too,<br />
Then St. Lawrence bade him what to do.</p>

<p class="p05">"My dear old friend, sit down, sit down;<br />
'Tis easy for us now to drown</p>
<p class="p06">All obstacles that's in our way<br />
To carry out our plan today."</p>

<p class="p05">Then he proceeded to relate<br />
How easy men in Empire State</p>
<p class="p06">Could call in witness to their deed<br />
And satisfy all fortune's creed.</p>

<p class="p05">"Now, look-a-here, my friend St. Lawrence,<br />
You cannot be too quick</p>
<p class="p06">To tell me how we'll do all this<br />
And make this bargain stick."</p>

<p class="p05">And then the sage St. Lawrence did say:<br />
"Look here, my friend, here is our way!</p>
<p class="p06">I'll make my will of my estate<br />
(And that, you know, is very great,)</p>

<p class="p05">"Unto your fair and lovely child,<br />
If she refrains from being wild,</p>
<p class="p06">And when she weds she weds my son,<br />
My noble, brave and kind Trueman.</p>

<p class="p05">"Then you, my friend, reciprocate;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>You make your will of this same date,</p>
<p class="p06">And seal as I do mine;<br />
Make True, my son, your legatee,</p>

<p class="p05">"And to him give, in simple fee,<br />
Your lands, your goods, your kine, your cash,</p>
<p class="p06">All in one grand and mighty crash,<br />
If he your daughter weds."</p>

<p class="p05">The witnesses were duly called;<br />
The wills were then prepared;</p>
<p class="p06">The testators did sign their names,<br />
The children they well fared.</p>

<p class="p05">The documents were laid away<br />
In vaults of solid rock;</p>
<p class="p06">There safely for the children kept,<br />
Their heritage of stock.</p>

<p class="p05">Years, years rolled on and Trueman grew<br />
To be a handsome man.</p>
<p class="p06">He said: "I'm bound to be "M. D."<br />
And do the best I can."</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie, on the other hand,<br />
Grew to be a queen;</p>
<p class="p06">And when to college she did go<br />
Trueman there was seen.</p>

<p class="p05">They played at home, when they were young,<br />
Upon the mountain side,</p>
<p class="p06">And never once did they mistrust<br />
They'd be both groom and bride.</p>

<p class="p05">When Trueman closed his college course<br />
He off to Gotham went,</p>
<p class="p06">To become an adept in his class<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>While on his mission bent.</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie, on the other hand,<br />
When she had closed her term,</p>
<p class="p06">Returned unto her mountain home,<br />
For which she hourly yearned.</p>

<p class="p05">Two years had changed this happy home<br />
To one most sadly grieved;</p>
<p class="p06">The mother of this lovely girl<br />
Had sadly been deceived.</p>

<p class="p05">She, down upon her death bed lay,<br />
When in came Sadie one bright day</p>
<p class="p06">And gazed upon the shrunken form<br />
Which now had battled life's hard storm.</p>

<p class="p05">Poor Sadie, with a broken heart,<br />
She did the best to take her part;</p>
<p class="p06">But long the sickness did not last,<br />
Because her mother now soon passed</p>

<p class="p05">From time into eternity,<br />
Where the human soul is ever free.</p>
<p class="p06">Trueman now, in city fashion,<br />
Had let die out his old-time passion</p>

<p class="p05">For rocks and rills and mountain side,<br />
Where dwelt the queen who'd be his bride.</p>
<p class="p06">So much for selfish, erring man;<br />
He'll do the best where e'er he can.</p>

<p class="p05">Time, time rolled on, when Sadie's sire,<br />
With renewed youth and boyhood ire,</p>
<p class="p06">Took to himself another wife,<br />
And tried anew to live his life.</p>

<p class="p05">The new-made mistress of the home<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>(Who had no place she called her own)</p>
<p class="p06">Was mother of a daughter fair,<br />
With dimpled cheeks and flowing hair.</p>

<p class="p05">The madame's name was Maria;<br />
<i>Her</i> daughter's was Sarah.</p>
<p class="p06">She soon was boss of all the house,<br />
And Sadie driven like a mouse</p>

<p class="p05">Into the cold and cheerless world.<br />
Sadie, with a broken heart,</p>
<p class="p06">Prayed her father take her part;<br />
But he, with proud and dire disdain,<br />
Forever did refrain.</p>

<p class="p05">Then Sadie, on her mother's grave,<br />
Prayed loud and long for God to save</p>
<p class="p06">Her soul from earthly wreck.<br />
Then, with a palpitating heart,</p>

<p class="p05">With one fond look she did depart<br />
To battle hard with broken heart;</p>
<p class="p06">While daughter and a second wife<br />
Should all but ruin her young life.</p>

<p class="p05">But father did as fathers do,<br />
When their list of wives have numbered <i>two</i>;</p>
<p class="p06">He lent his daughter a deaf ear,<br />
For his second wife he then did fear.</p>

<p class="p05">His life was short; he soon became<br />
A victim to a raging pain,</p>
<p class="p06">Which soon relieved him from this life<br />
And bore him off from life's hard strife.</p>

<p class="p05">They laid him low beside his wife,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>The pride and joy of Sadie's life;</p>
<p class="p06">But Sadie knew not of the fate<br />
Her father had so sadly met.</p>

<p class="p05">The new-made widow, without tear,<br />
Prepared to move, within a year,</p>
<p class="p06">To far and distant foreign land,<br />
Where neither had a single friend.</p>

<p class="p05">The goods were sold, the stock and kine;<br />
The lands were leased for a long time;</p>
<p class="p06">The two, with pockets filled with gold,<br />
Sailed for Paris with joys untold.</p>

<p class="p05">Young Sarah, who was quite a belle,<br />
When in old Paris she did swell</p>
<p class="p06">Her wardrobe with both silk and lace,<br />
And numerous paints to ply her face.</p>

<p class="p05">She was the very counterpart&mdash;<br />
Although 'tis strange to say&mdash;</p>
<p class="p06">Of pretty <i>Sadie</i> Waddington<br />
In all her dainty ways.</p>

<p class="p05">She spread herself around, about,<br />
In all society's halls,</p>
<p class="p06">And never failed, when chance availed,<br />
To attend the stylish balls.</p>

<p class="p05">She was a favorite with them all,<br />
In fact, the Queenly Belle,</p>
<p class="p06">And many a suitor's prayer she heard<br />
While on bended knee he fell.</p>

<p class="p05">One evening while on promenade<br />
Within society's halls,</p>
<p class="p06">She met a handsome, tall young man<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>She'd seen at some of the balls.</p>

<p class="p05">When introduced, both their eyes met,<br />
She blushing timidly;</p>
<p class="p06">He heard the name, "Miss Waddington,"<br />
Then asked most courteously:</p>

<p class="p05">"From what part of America's soil<br />
Do you and your friends hail?</p>
<p class="p06">Or have you lived in Paris long?<br />
On what liner did you sail"?</p>

<p class="p05">She said: "I'm Sadie Waddington,<br />
From the city that bears my name;</p>
<p class="p06">It borders on the old St. Lawrence,<br />
A river of world-wide fame."</p>

<p class="p05">Then spake the handsome gentleman:<br />
"I, too, am from that place;</p>
<p class="p06">And if you are Sadie Waddington,<br />
I ought to know your face."</p>

<p class="p05">Her cheeks grew flushed and flushed again,<br />
As on her he searchingly gazed;</p>
<p class="p06">She looked up in his solemn face<br />
And saw he was greatly amazed.</p>

<p class="p05">It was Trueman St. Lawrence she saw,<br />
As she gazed on his beautiful form;</p>
<p class="p06">She was more than bewitching in her ways<br />
To capture him all by storm.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor went to his hotel<br />
To ponder the matter o'er:</p>
<p class="p06">"That's not the Sadie Waddington<br />
I've seen in days of yore."</p>

<p class="p05">His brain was puzzled, his face was flushed.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>He was in a frenzied mood;</p>
<p class="p06">He could not fathom the mystery<br />
To do the best he could.</p>

<p class="p05">If that's the girl in days of youth<br />
I played with on the mountain side,</p>
<p class="p06">Before I leave this old city<br />
I'll make her my darling bride.</p>

<p class="p05">So saying, he sank upon his couch,<br />
And slept in dreams so rich and gay</p>
<p class="p06">That loud his servant called and called,<br />
Because 'twas late&mdash;far in the day.</p>

<p class="p05">That day he had a trip to make<br />
Unto a neighboring town,</p>
<p class="p06">And visited a hospital<br />
Kept by a Doctor Brown.</p>

<p class="p05">In passing from one of the wards,<br />
While in the open door,</p>
<p class="p06">He chanced to turn, and looking back<br />
Saw, kneeling on the floor,</p>

<p class="p05">With outstretched arms and pleading eyes,<br />
The girl for years he had not seen;</p>
<p class="p06">She'd grown into full womanhood,<br />
She was a perfect fairy Queen.</p>

<p class="p05">"What! what!" he cried, "am I deceived?<br />
If I'm my father's son</p>
<p class="p06">That girl I see back yonder<br />
Is <i>Sadie Waddington!</i>"</p>

<p class="p05">He hastened back to where she knelt,<br />
And bade her to arise,</p>
<p class="p06">And clasped her to his manly breast,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>While tears rose in his eyes.</p>

<p class="p05">Then 'tween her sobs and moans and groans<br />
She slowly did relate</p>
<p class="p06">How she was driven from her home<br />
Back in the Empire State.</p>

<p class="p05">She told of awful suffering,<br />
Of wandering far and near;</p>
<p class="p06">Of the death of father and mother,<br />
To her <i>all</i> that was dear.</p>

<p class="p05">She told him how she had returned<br />
Unto her mountain dome,</p>
<p class="p06">And as she was told that all had been sold,<br />
She was left without a home.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor stood transfixed with awe;<br />
Listened to her relate</p>
<p class="p06">The story of the sale of all,<br />
Back in the Empire State.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor said: "My dear Sadie,<br />
It matters not a bit to me</p>
<p class="p06">Whether you have lands, or goods, or gold,<br />
I have vast fortunes yet untold.</p>

<p class="p05">"What's mine is yours; 'tis always so,<br />
My father told me long ago,</p>
<p class="p06">Before I left the Empire State<br />
And came over here to study late.</p>

<p class="p05">"I offer you my heart and hand,<br />
And pledge to seal it with the band</p>
<p class="p06">Of holy wedlock, faithfully.<br />
Now set your heart forever free</p>

<p class="p05">"From labor and the toils of life,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Come, say you'll be my darling wife!</p>
<p class="p06">I feel a pang about my heart<br />
That pierces like a flashing dart."</p>

<p class="p05">"Oh, True. St. Lawrence! Oh, can it be<br />
That you do really care for me?</p>
<p class="p06">I, who have lived by a false name<br />
To hide a step-mother's wicked shame?</p>

<p class="p05">"For five long years my name has been<br />
(As you directly would have seen),</p>
<p class="p06">Not Sadie W., as you have known,<br />
But the Sadie changed to plain Salome.</p>

<p class="p05">"The Waddington I changed, also,<br />
For the common name of Van Harlow;</p>
<p class="p06">Then among strangers I did seek<br />
For work to do, although 'twas meek.</p>

<p class="p05">"I came across the ocean wide,<br />
As servant to a new-made bride;</p>
<p class="p06">She was taken sick and died out here<br />
Before she'd been a bride a year.</p>

<p class="p05">"Since then I've cared for poor and sick,<br />
And cannot leave them now, so quick.</p>
<p class="p06">I patients have who <i>must</i> have care<br />
Before <i>I</i> leave for better fare.</p>

<p class="p05">"Now True, my dear, I'll be your own;<br />
I'll make you an ever happy home;</p>
<p class="p06">I feel Pa's oft' spoke words are true,<br />
Trueman's your name, <i>True Man</i> are you."</p>

<p class="p05">He pressed her closely to his breast:<br />
To dry her tears he did his best;</p>
<p class="p06">Then gently kissed her burning cheeks<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>And bade her wait but a few weeks.</p>

<p class="p05">The happiest man in all the land<br />
Was True. St. Lawrence, with trembling hand,</p>
<p class="p06">Who then returned to his rooms rich,<br />
A restless night to roll and pitch</p>

<p class="p05">Upon a bed of faultless down,<br />
But pains of heart it could not drown.</p>
<p class="p06">He lay and mused throughout the night,<br />
'Cause his future now looked bright.</p>

<p class="p05"><i>Sarah</i> Waddington and her mother<br />
Prepared a party for another.</p>
<p class="p06">A gent they wished to entertain,<br />
'Cause Sarah wished to bear his name.</p>

<p class="p05">"It is to be a swell affair,<br />
So she could safely set her snare</p>
<p class="p06">To catch the unsuspecting True,<br />
Because he loves and loves but you."</p>

<p class="p05">So spake the mother to her child,<br />
Who seemed delighted&mdash;almost wild&mdash;</p>
<p class="p06">To think that she could play her part<br />
Without remorse or pain at heart.</p>

<p class="p05">The time rolled on, and days were spent<br />
In fixing up for the event;</p>
<p class="p06">The rich were called from every side<br />
To see Sarah&mdash;the would-be bride.</p>

<p class="p05">She sent a most bewitching note<br />
For Dr. 'Lawrence to cast the vote,</p>
<p class="p06">Who'd be the Belle of honor, bright,<br />
To bear the graces of the night.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor smiled, as he sat down<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>To answer it, without a frown;</p>
<p class="p06">And faithfully he did outline,<br />
In characters most cute and fine:</p>

<p class="p05">"My choice is one, and only one;<br />
And now I've written and 'tis done!</p>
<p class="p06">As sure as I'm my father's son,<br />
'Tis one&mdash;fair <i>Sadie</i> Waddington!</p>

<p class="p05">"And now, before it is too late,<br />
There's one request I have to make:</p>
<p class="p06">That I be granted then, or sooner,<br />
To be escort to the maid of honor."</p>

<p class="p05">"Your request is at once granted,<br />
And hope we'll become enchanted;</p>
<p class="p06">And with your presence'll be elated,<br />
Because, it seems, we are related".</p>

<p class="p05">Fair Sarah, then, did make it known<br />
(Real quietly about her home)</p>
<p class="p06">That she and 'Lawrence, raised side by side,<br />
Would soon become both groom and bride.</p>

<p class="p05">Silks and diamonds bought with gold,<br />
Gotten from the kine she'd sold</p>
<p class="p06">'Way back in the Empire State,<br />
Where poor Sadie met her fate.</p>

<p class="p05">Just one week before the eve'<br />
When he Sarah would deceive,</p>
<p class="p06">Trueman went to see his love,<br />
Who was pretty as a dove.</p>

<p class="p05">"Sadie," said he, "sweet is revenge!<br />
Let us now your labor change.</p>
<p class="p06">The ones who drove you to your fate,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Away back in the Empire State,</p>

<p class="p05">"Are here in Paris this long time,<br />
And live in luxury sublime.</p>
<p class="p06">The gold they got from off your kine,<br />
It goes for suppers and for wine.</p>

<p class="p05">"In holy wedlock let us wed,<br />
I'll lead you to a bridal bed;</p>
<p class="p06">And then in luxury and state<br />
We'll 'tend the ball ere 'tis too late".</p>

<p class="p05">I'll humble them in dust and shame!<br />
Ah, Sadie, you were not to blame!</p>
<p class="p06"><i>We'll</i> make them wish they'd never sold<br />
Your goods and kine for glittering gold!</p>

<p class="p05">"Come, darling, now we'll off today,<br />
The bridal knot to firmly tie.</p>
<p class="p06">Then I your graceful swanlike neck<br />
With pearls and rubys will bedeck.</p>

<p class="p05">"I'll trim your lovely graceful form<br />
With richest satin to be worn:</p>
<p class="p06">I'll place upon your tapered hand<br />
A solitaire, set in gold band.</p>

<p class="p05">"Your dainty feet encased in kid<br />
Of dainty styles, they're only made</p>
<p class="p06">For those who're called the name of Queens,<br />
And bought by those who have vast means.</p>

<p class="p05">"Then to the ball we'll proudly go,<br />
(And who we'll meet I do not know,)</p>
<p class="p06">I'll there present to every one<br />
My bride, <i>true</i> Sadie Waddington.</p>

<p class="p05">"The shock, so sudden, will be great;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>They'll quail beneath their hearts own hate</p>
<p class="p06">Of being there exposed to all;<br />
Oh, won't it be an awful fall?</p>

<p class="p05">"Come, Sadie dear, revenge is sweet!<br />
Now is our chance to get your mete</p>
<p class="p06">Which they have held from you so long,<br />
And did you such a cruel wrong."</p>

<p class="p05">Then Sadie spoke: "Trueman, my dear,<br />
There's naught I know for me to fear.</p>
<p class="p06">Revenge <i>is</i> sweet, although 'tis queer,<br />
Revenge I get in Paris here."</p>

<p class="p05">They carried out their little plot,<br />
And never skipped a single jot.</p>
<p class="p06">The eve was fine, the folk were gay,<br />
And not a thing stood in their way.</p>

<p class="p05">It was quite late when they arrived<br />
At the mansion of the would-be bride.</p>
<p class="p06">As soon as Doctor stepped in sight,<br />
Escorting Sadie&mdash;his delight&mdash;</p>

<p class="p05">Sarah saw the graceful form<br />
And, with one scream, she left the room,</p>
<p class="p06">And fell fainting to the floor.<br />
They gently laid her on the couch</p>

<p class="p05">Before the open door.<br />
Her mother came in haste to see</p>
<p class="p06">What all the trouble there could be,<br />
And did not see the Doctor's bride</p>

<p class="p05">Until she was close by her side.<br />
And when she saw it was too late,</p>
<p class="p06">She gasped: "Oh, Sarah's met her fate,"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>Then fell into a deathly state.</p>

<p class="p05">The mother swooned and swooned away<br />
The entire night and most the day;</p>
<p class="p06">And then the Doctor came to say,<br />
"Her life is run, she cannot stay!"</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie, with trained and skillful hand,<br />
Nursed Sarah back to conscious-land;</p>
<p class="p06">Did faithfully the watchword keep<br />
While often o'er them she did weep.</p>

<p class="p05">And, just before the mother died,<br />
She Sadie called to her bedside</p>
<p class="p06">And begged her to full pardon give<br />
For cruel wrong she did receive.</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie, always so good and true,<br />
Said she always thought she knew</p>
<p class="p06">That the grand day would surely come<br />
When that great wrong would be undone.</p>

<p class="p05">She granted full, complete pardon<br />
For all the wrongs the dame had done,</p>
<p class="p06">And then she spoke kind words of cheer<br />
Into the madam's dying ear.</p>

<p class="p05">With firm-set eyes and drooping chin<br />
The madame grasped and tried to cling</p>
<p class="p06">Unto the hand she once did scorn,<br />
And drove from home at break of morn.</p>

<p class="p05">She then was wrapt in eternal death,<br />
And from her soul came not a breath.</p>
<p class="p06">In casket pure as driven snow<br />
Unto the churchyard she did go,</p>

<p class="p05">And there was laid beneath the clay<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>To await Jehovah's Judgment Day.</p>
<p class="p06">All lands and goods and gold and kine<br />
She left behind for endless time!</p>

<p class="p05">Poor Sarah! doomed to awful fate,<br />
Her mind was left in ruined state;</p>
<p class="p06">In raving madness and in strife<br />
She tried to take our Sadie's life.</p>

<p class="p05">The best physicians in the land<br />
Were summoned forth on every hand</p>
<p class="p06">To try and bring her from the strife<br />
Back to the land of happy life.</p>

<p class="p05">Off to an asylum she must go,<br />
'Cause 'twas not safe to leave her so;</p>
<p class="p06">And with good care she might regain<br />
And be relieved from mental pain.</p>

<p class="p05">Salome, our faithful lass and bride,<br />
Resolved to stay by Sarah's side</p>
<p class="p06">And help her regain her lost mind,<br />
And comfort for her she would find.</p>

<p class="p05">Nine weeks were spent in mad-house fare,<br />
Salome bestowing tender care</p>
<p class="p06">Upon the one who once did face<br />
Salome in all her dire disgrace.</p>

<p class="p05">When Doctor St. Lawrence saw his wife<br />
Was bent on battling for the life</p>
<p class="p06">Of one who was once her mad foe,<br />
He said: "All right, it shall be so."</p>

<p class="p05">Salome, she clung unto her charge,<br />
As if she were her dearest friend;</p>
<p class="p06">She incurred expenses somewhat large<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>To treat her patient to the end.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor soon began to learn<br />
His bride and wife would never spurn</p>
<p class="p06">The one who once her home did take,<br />
And drove her off for mere pride's sake.</p>

<p class="p05">He asked Salome what she would do<br />
In case that Sarah did pull through,</p>
<p class="p06">And once again her mind regain<br />
Before they crossed the raging main.</p>

<p class="p05">Salome did quickly make reply,<br />
While glistening tears stood in her eye:</p>
<p class="p06">"I'll take her to old Empire State,<br />
Right to the door where I met fate!</p>

<p class="p05">"I'll make her happy, if I can,<br />
And now I'll form my little plan:</p>
<p class="p06">We must, dear True, just do our best,<br />
And fix her up in a cosy nest.</p>

<p class="p05">"We will give her a little home<br />
On the beautiful mountain side;</p>
<p class="p06">We will find her a handsome lover<br />
Who'll be proud to call her his bride.</p>

<p class="p05">"We will give them all attention<br />
That the best of friends could do;</p>
<p class="p06">We will <i>return good for evil</i>,<br />
'Cause my mother taught me so.</p>

<p class="p05">"Let us show that true religion<br />
Is the life we ought to live,</p>
<p class="p06">And the ways that Christ rejoiced in<br />
Are the ways to which we cleave.</p>

<p class="p05">"Oh, my husband, dearest Trueman,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>I believe in Sarah reigns</p>
<p class="p06">The true principle of goodness&mdash;<br />
Let us fan that spark to flames.</p>

<p class="p05">"Can I now secure her safely,<br />
Teach her shun her evil ways</p>
<p class="p06">And discard that haughty spirit<br />
That she learned in younger days,</p>

<p class="p05">"I will be the happiest mortal<br />
Ever lived on mother earth,</p>
<p class="p06">And will reach that heavenly portal<br />
Only reached by second birth."</p>

<p class="p05">After coaxing, begging, teasing,<br />
Sarah consented for to go</p>
<p class="p06">Back across the ocean, raging,<br />
Where her childhood seeds did sow.</p>

<p class="p05">When they reached the harbor safely,<br />
Bag and baggage on the truck,</p>
<p class="p06">They cast lots to see what steamer<br />
They would choose for their good luck.</p>

<p class="p05">Doctor got the choice of vessels,<br />
And he quickly did decide</p>
<p class="p06">That the City of St. Paris<br />
Should take their <i>protege</i> and his bride.</p>

<p class="p05">Safely in the vessel's cabin,<br />
Housed in cosy stateroom there,</p>
<p class="p06">All were ready for the voyage,<br />
And did look for cheerful fare.</p>

<p class="p05">Out upon the briny billows,<br />
Just three days and nights, 'twas said,</p>
<p class="p06">When the night was dark and dreary,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>Trueman rose from sleepless bed.</p>

<p class="p05">There was something weighed upon him,<br />
Something whispered to beware;</p>
<p class="p06">He dressed and went upon the deck<br />
To breathe the crisp sea air.</p>

<p class="p05">He paced and paced the vessel's deck<br />
With long and manly stride;</p>
<p class="p06">He went from starboard o'er to port<br />
And back to starboard side.</p>

<p class="p05">He'd been upon the deck some time,<br />
And peered into the gloom</p>
<p class="p06">As if them something overawed<br />
And threatened them with doom.</p>

<p class="p05">At last, to port, he spied a fleck,<br />
A dancing on the waves,</p>
<p class="p06">And there he plainly saw a deck<br />
Bedecked with pirate knaves.</p>

<p class="p05">The vessel, with a dark-hued hull,<br />
Bore straightway on its course,</p>
<p class="p06">When, "<i>Hard to port! To port! to port!</i>"<br />
Rang out a voice real coarse.</p>

<p class="p05">The strange boat glided swiftly on,<br />
Like a ghost on phantom wings,</p>
<p class="p06">While the crisp sea breeze went dancing past<br />
And through her rigging sings.</p>

<p class="p05">The strange boat slipped along, across<br />
The briny billows white,</p>
<p class="p06">And their steamer ploughed and labored hard<br />
Along its renewed flight.</p>

<p class="p05">It was a close and dangerous call,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Because the night was dark;</p>
<p class="p06">Had they collided there, on the ocean bare,<br />
They'd went down with their bark.</p>

<p class="p05">The voyage, then, to Gotham<br />
Was stormy and quite rough,</p>
<p class="p06">And all agreed, when landed,<br />
That they had quite enough.</p>

<p class="p05">They then all took the railroad train<br />
North, through the Empire State,</p>
<p class="p06">And soon were on the mountain side<br />
Where Sadie met her fate.</p>

<p class="p05">The first place Sadie wished to see<br />
Was graves of father and mother,</p>
<p class="p06">And tripping lightly from the yard,<br />
She passed out with another.</p>

<p class="p05">That bitter morn, with memories fresh,<br />
When from her home she'd fled,</p>
<p class="p06">She was scorned by one <i>now</i> too glad<br />
To lead her on ahead.</p>

<p class="p05">When she approached her mother's grave<br />
The tears rolled thick and fast,</p>
<p class="p06">And by her side poor Sarah stood,<br />
With memories of the past</p>

<p class="p05">A fitting through her guilty mind:<br />
And then she spoke at last:</p>
<p class="p06">"Oh, Sadie, Sadie, what a blot<br />
Upon my mother's past;</p>

<p class="p05">It stings within my guilty heart,<br />
And would to God I now could part</p>
<p class="p06">With half the pain I feel&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>The balm of Christ could scarcely heal."</p>

<p class="p05">She stooped, and silently did press<br />
Her fresh and rosy lips</p>
<p class="p06">Upon the little mound of grass<br />
"Beneath&mdash;dear mother sleeps."</p>

<p class="p05">Then Sarah, with most tender words,<br />
Pressed Sadie to her breast</p>
<p class="p06">And with a fervent, heartfelt plea,<br />
Prayed both them to be blest.</p>

<p class="p05">When they returned unto their home,<br />
Their friendship sealed with silent love,</p>
<p class="p06">They could not bear to be alone;<br />
They felt a power from up above.</p>

<p class="p05">Old friends and neighbors, with delight,<br />
Called on the Doctor and his bride,</p>
<p class="p06">And there convened, on the first night,<br />
A host of friends who're on their side.</p>

<p class="p05">There's one among them old and gray,<br />
Who'd lived right there for all his life;</p>
<p class="p06">'Tis the elder man and sage, St. Lawrence,<br />
And he smiles upon the Doctor's wife.</p>

<p class="p05">Heir to the Waddington estate,<br />
Sadie reigns the queen of all;</p>
<p class="p06">Her friendship for Sarah was great,<br />
And sister her did often call.</p>

<p class="p05">The Doctor chose to spend his life<br />
Upon the handsome mountain side</p>
<p class="p06">With Sadie, his true loving wife,<br />
And Father St. Lawrence until he died.</p>

<p class="p05">Time rolled around and months flew by;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Sadie and Sarah, hand in hand,</p>
<p class="p06">Sealed by the firmest friendship tie,<br />
Two of the truest in the land.</p>

<p class="p05">There chanced to stroll from distant clime<br />
A bright young man of Sadie's kin;</p>
<p class="p06">Came to visit in Summer time,<br />
And Sarah was introduced to him.</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie tried her best to make a match,<br />
And championed well her cause;</p>
<p class="p06">Sarah viewed it as a catch<br />
That one very seldom draws.</p>

<p class="p05">Though 'twas but a short acquaintance,<br />
Still the wedding time was fixed;</p>
<p class="p06">The intended groom had patience,<br />
'Cause he felt he was not rich.</p>

<p class="p05">Sadie, sweet as dewy honey,<br />
Wishing that her friends should wed,</p>
<p class="p06">Proffered home and lands and money<br />
If the word would just be said.</p>

<p class="p05">"I am heir to all this fortune,<br />
Known as Waddington's estate;</p>
<p class="p06">Come, now, Sarah; come, now, Hawthorne,<br />
Join your hearts ere 'tis too late.</p>

<p class="p05">"I will give to you a large farm<br />
Yonder on the mountain side;</p>
<p class="p06">I will give you kine and money,<br />
If you'll be my cousin's bride."</p>

<p class="p05">Sarah spake, with dewy eyelids,<br />
To the one she loved so dear:</p>
<p class="p06">"Sadie, I am anything but worthy<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Of this princely gift, to cheer</p>

<p class="p05">"My poor broken, wicked heart,<br />
After I have been so bad;</p>
<p class="p06">You should never take <i>my</i> part,<br />
Since <i>I</i> took that which <i>you</i> had."</p>

<p class="p05">Yet Sadie, true to her own passion,<br />
Promised deed in fee for all,</p>
<p class="p06">If Sarah would wed her own cousin,<br />
Ere the Summer ran to Fall.</p>

<p class="p05">So the wedding day was fixed<br />
When the two should be made one,</p>
<p class="p06">And their home, as she predicted,<br />
Would be deeded as their own.</p>

<p class="p05">When at last the nuptial greeting<br />
Was received on every hand,</p>
<p class="p06">The sage, St. Lawrence, came to their meeting,<br />
The last one left of their quartet band.</p>

<p class="p05">The wedding knot was duly tied,<br />
And the folk were feeling gay;</p>
<p class="p06">They were now made happy groom and bride,<br />
Starting out in life's pathway.</p>

<p class="p05">When the ceremony was over,<br />
And the gifts they were bestowing&mdash;</p>
<p class="p06">Bridal gifts as sweet as clover&mdash;<br />
Sadie, with her rich hair flowing,</p>

<p class="p05">Called the old 'Squire of the city<br />
That to witness of her signing</p>
<p class="p06">The transfer of title fair,<br />
To the land that lay up there;</p>

<p class="p05">When, to her surprise and chagrin,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>Father St. Lawrence, with gentle voice,</p>
<p class="p06">Told her that she could not bargain,<br />
For she had not even choice.</p>

<p class="p05">"Now, my daughter, not one farthing<br />
Of this vast and rich estate</p>
<p class="p06">Has been left unto True's darling,<br />
Now, I tell you, 'tis not too late.</p>

<p class="p05">"All this land you tho't was yours<br />
By inheritance of your blood,</p>
<p class="p06">Was bequeathed by your dear father<br />
To one you never thought he would".</p>

<p class="p05">Now, I've brought the Judge of Probate<br />
As an honored guest of <i>mine</i>,</p>
<p class="p06">That he might reveal the truth,<br />
That it might be writ in rhyme.</p>

<p class="p05">Then, to soothe the disappointment,<br />
The old judge with silvery hair</p>
<p class="p06">Drew from 'neath his outer garment,<br />
Two old papers kept with care.</p>

<p class="p05">One was read by him to Sadie,<br />
Where her father had endowed</p>
<p class="p06">All his lands, and kine and money<br />
On the one who made her proud.</p>

<p class="p05">When this document was ended,<br />
And was handed to Trueman,</p>
<p class="p06">The old sage, St. Lawrence, pretended<br />
That he enjoyed youth again.</p>

<p class="p05">"Read, Judge! read your other paper!<br />
Tell my daughter here the truth;</p>
<p class="p06">Tell her what their anxious fathers<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Did for them while in their youth."</p>

<p class="p05">When the document was ended,<br />
With tears showering down her face,</p>
<p class="p06">Sadie, kisses, sweetly blended,<br />
While she held him in embrace.</p>

<p class="p05">Long their fortunes had been blended<br />
By the signatures alone</p>
<p class="p06">Of their fathers in their child days,<br />
As they played around their home.</p>

<p class="p05">"True, my dear; O will you come here?<br />
Sign this deed! Come quick, O do;</p>
<p class="p06">Carry out my simple wishes;<br />
Sarah is my friend, so true."</p>

<p class="p05">"Yes, my darling, this with pleasure<br />
I will do, to please you all;</p>
<p class="p06">It is my most pleasant leisure<br />
To do bidding at your call."</p>

<p class="p05">So, the deed of gift was given,<br />
And in happiness they'd start;</p>
<p class="p06">From that home they'd ne'er be driven,<br />
Life anew to never part.</p>

<p class="p05">There in happiness and comfort<br />
Did they live upon the place</p>
<p class="p06">Where the evil of proud passion<br />
Smothered one in dire disgrace.</p>

<p class="p05">Happy was Salome and Trueman<br />
When they saw their <i>protege</i> safe</p>
<p class="p06">In the hands of Cousin Hawthorne,<br />
On the Waddington old place.</p>

<p class="p05">Safe within the coils of homelife,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Safe within the cottage walls,</p>
<p class="p06">Safely with a trusting husband,<br />
Safe within their friendly calls.</p>

<p class="p05">Thus the vengeance of our Hero<br />
Was full spent to meet her theme;</p>
<p class="p06">Yet so different from a Nero,<br />
Because she knew she could redeem.</p>

<p class="p05">Salome's revenge was to her sweet,<br />
'Cause she'd conquered, not cut down;</p>
<p class="p06">Now she feared no one to meet,<br />
Nor would any wear a frown.</p>

<p class="p05">Though some years had been so bitter,<br />
And had fraught such cruel pain;</p>
<p class="p06">Now the coldest of the winter<br />
Seemed like flowery beds of green.</p>

<p class="p05">Now, away up on the mountains,<br />
In the well known Empire State,</p>
<p class="p06">Sadie Waddington is living<br />
In sweet REVENGE, where she met fate.</p>

<p class="p01">In prison cell, at early twilight,<br />
Smoking Foesters "Best Cigar,"</p>
<p class="p02">Sat a convict, little dreaming<br />
Aught his perfect bliss could mar.</p>

<p class="p01">Round the cell-block, slowly ambling,<br />
Came a "Screw," on mischief bent,</p>
<p class="p02">And his wide, expanded nostrils<br />
Quickly inhaled the welcome scent.</p>

<p class="p01">Wave on wave, thro' latticed iron,<br />
Smoky clouds rose thick and high,</p>
<p class="p02">And the happy convict murmured:<br />
"Go, ye cloudlets, greet the sky!"</p>

<p class="p01">But the cloudlets, incense laden,<br />
Lingered near the oaken floor,</p>
<p class="p02">Till the "Screw," with cat-like motion,<br />
Stood before the smoker's door.</p>

<p class="p01">In the spittoon, charred and sputtering,<br />
Lay the smoker's joy and pride;</p>
<p class="p02">And the "Screw," exultant, murmured:<br />
"Stackhouse will <i>this case</i> decide."</p>

<p class="p01">Morning dawned. The "cellar agent"<br />
Bore the trembling wretch away</p>
<p class="p02">To a cellar, cold and gloomy,<br />
Where the tools of torture lay.</p>

<p class="p01">Blows and shrieks alternate sounded,<br />
And a voice from near the floor</p>
<p class="p02">Murmured: "Stackhouse! <span class="smcap">mercy! MERCY!!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]></a></span>P-l-e-a-s-e, sir; <i>I will smoke no more!</i>"</p>

<p class="p01">From the cellar, shorn and shaven,<br />
Skulked the cowering "con." away;</p>
<p class="p02">And he smokes&mdash;but, Oh! how watchful<br />
Is that victim, who can say?</p>

<p class="p01">All ye inmates, take the warning,<br />
Gushing from a brother's heart:</p>
<p class="p02">He who smokes within these portals<br />
For the dire offense <i>may</i> smart!</p>

<p class="pn center">BY GEO. W. H. HARRISON.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="p23">Two lovers once sat dreaming<br />
Of scenes o'ergrown by years;<br />
Sweet Daisy's eyes were eloquent<br />
With girlhood's pleading tears;<br />
Her little hand was lying<br />
Confidingly in mine,<br />
While her silvery voice pleaded:<br />
"Dear one, awake the Nine!"</p>

<p class="p23">"Yes, darling, I will rhyme for you;<br />
What legend shall I drew!<br />
Shall I now fold you in my arms<br />
And, drifting down life's stream,<br />
'Mid singing birds and nodding flowers,<br />
Pour forth my soul in love&mdash;<br />
In accents soft and tender&mdash;<br />
As the cooing of a dove"?</p>

<p class="p23">Or shall I tell you, dearest one,<br />
Why yonder's rippling stream<br />
First gained the name "Tululah"<br />
In an age that's now a dream?<br />
Well, now, pillow your head upon my breast,<br />
The legend is weird and wild;<br />
I fear me much its harrowing scenes<br />
Will shock, thee, gentle child.</p>

<p class="p23">Will you listen, while we're watching<br />
For the far-famed Phantom Boat?<br />
Perhaps the tale will lead us<br />
To catch the first faint note<br />
Of Tululah's wondrous music<br />
As she floats down this stream,<br />
For, I assure you, darling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>This legend is no dream.</p>

<p class="p23">Where now we sit, in days gone by,<br />
The stealthy panther crept,<br />
And bears and wolves in horrid hordes<br />
Their tireless vigils kept;<br />
Turkey, deer and beaver<br />
Were scattered far and wide,<br />
And here the lordly savage stalked<br />
<i>In all his pristine pride</i>;</p>

<p class="p23">The Creeks then ruled this forest,<br />
From Suwanee to the sea;&mdash;<br />
A haughty, bold and cruel race,<br />
Cunning, treacherous, wild and free!<br />
To hunt and fish, and boast and fight<br />
Were the duties of a brave,<br />
While woman&mdash;alas! sweet woman<br />
Was but a cowering slave!</p>

<p class="p23">No grant had she to breathe her wrongs<br />
Before the "Council Fire,"<br />
Nor dared she utter a single word<br />
To gain her heart's desire,<br />
Until her savage master<br />
First gave her leave to speak;<br />
Nor dared she then to brave his will<br />
Lest he his vengeance wreak!</p>

<p class="p23">Yet ever and anon there rose<br />
A woman, whose proud soul<br />
Ignored those self-created gods<br />
And spurned their base control.<br />
Such was the brave Tululah,<br />
Whose spirit haunts this stream;<br />
In a phantom barge it glides along,<br />
Like a wraith in a troubled dream.</p>

<p class="p23">'Tis said she haunts this river,<br />
Alone on a misty night,<br />
And that each one who sees her<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>Is 'palled with strange affright!<br />
And why she haunts this river<br />
Is the burden of my tale,<br />
And none who have a tender heart<br />
But will her fate bewail.</p>

<p class="p23">Tululah was Ocala's child,<br />
To whom the Creeks ascribe<br />
The name of the boldest leader<br />
That ever led their tribe!<br />
A savage of herculean build,<br />
With fierce and restless eye,<br />
His haughty lip deigned not to smile,<br />
And scorned to breathe a sigh!</p>

<p class="p23">Tululah was his pride and joy,<br />
The only thing he loved on earth,<br />
Since she became an orphan<br />
At the fatal hour of birth!<br />
The superstitious savage<br />
Deemed her mother's spirit nigh,<br />
And thought, who harmed an orphan,<br />
By a spirit hand should die!</p>

<p class="p23">She was born, too, "In a Castle,"<br />
Gifted with a "second sight;"<br />
Friends of earth, and sea, and air,<br />
At <i>her</i> command would fight.<br />
Her raven locks and soulful eyes,<br />
Her faultless form and peerless face,<br />
And voice of wondrous melody<br />
Awed and charmed her race.</p>

<p class="p23">She reigned an undisputed Queen,<br />
<i>All</i> her mandate must obey;<br />
And even the fierce Ocala<br />
Was obedient to her sway.<br />
Yet even she was powerless<br />
To stay the raging flood<br />
Of tireless, deathless savage hate<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>That sought the white man's blood.</p>

<p class="p23">Ocala's hatred of the whites<br />
Was known both far and near;<br />
Brave hunters spake his name with awe,<br />
And women in trembling fear!<br />
At last he grew so treacherous<br />
No white man dared come nigh,<br />
Till a trio of gallant hunters<br />
Determined <i>he should die!</i></p>

<p class="p23">They knew 'twas a dangerous mission<br />
On which their steps was bent,<br />
Yet the prayers of honest settlers<br />
Their true hearts courage lent.<br />
As they neared the sleeping village,<br />
Where Ocala awaited his doom,<br />
They flitted like weird spectres<br />
In the silent midnight gloom!</p>

<p class="p23">There, spread before their vision,<br />
Five hundred wigwams lay;<br />
A savage guerdon of defense<br />
For him they sought to slay.<br />
To the silent village center<br />
Our gallant hunters crept,<br />
To the door of the largest wigwam,<br />
Where proud Ocala slept.</p>

<p class="p23">Stepping across the prostrate form<br />
Of the sentinel at the door,<br />
They breathed a prayer for absent ones,<br />
Whom they might see no more.<br />
Three knives flashed in midnight air,<br />
Then fell with a sickening thud,<br />
Ocala, Napoleon of his tribe,<br />
Lay withering in his blood!</p>

<p class="p23">But hark! what means that fierce warhoop,<br />
Resounding loud and clear?<br />
'Tis the bugle blast that calls each brave<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>When the paleface foe is near!<br />
Gathering fast in the midnight gloom,<br />
They form "The Circle of Death"<br />
Around the dauntless hunters,<br />
Who stand with bated breath</p>

<p class="p23">Awaiting the savage onslaught,<br />
Determined to sell their lives<br />
To the service of their country<br />
And the freedom of men's wives;<br />
While pitying Heaven aids them<br />
By the darkness of the night,<br />
Since not a star will lend its aid<br />
To guide their foes aright!</p>

<p class="p23">Now facing North, and East, and West,<br />
They meet the savage foes,<br />
Recruiting Charon's army<br />
By every lusty blow;<br />
But still they come in hideous swarms,<br />
Like hounds let loose from hell,<br />
Till, overborne by numbers,<br />
Our bleeding heroes fell!</p>

<p class="p23">All honor to the gallant three,<br />
Twelve braves in silence lay,<br />
With gaping wounds and stony eyes,<br />
To greet returning day!<br />
While yet a score were nursing<br />
Wounds which these heroes gave,<br />
That signed their right to enter<br />
Into an unwept grave!</p>

<p class="p23">Ocala ne'er again would scourge<br />
Their country, far and near,<br />
Nor wring from helpless innocence<br />
An unavailing tear!<br />
His death alone destroyed the boast<br />
And stilled the raging flood<br />
Of senseless pride and passion<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>That bathed his hands in blood!</p>

<p class="p23">But, alas, for human prowess,<br />
These deeds but roused the ire<br />
Of savage wretches, who now tried<br />
To vent their spleen <i>with fire!</i><br />
Three stakes were now erected<br />
And fagots heaped around,<br />
While painted fiends in human shape<br />
Exultant, sat aground.</p>

<p class="p23">They led the helpless captives forth,<br />
With many a shout and hoot,<br />
And drug them to their awful doom,<br />
Less feeling than a brute!<br />
And first they bound Hugh Cannon,<br />
Whose descendants, love, you know,<br />
I pointed out to you, last Fall,<br />
When we were at the show.</p>

<p class="p23">They bound him to the cruel stake<br />
Before his comrades' eyes,<br />
Then scornfully they bade them mark<br />
"How a paleface coward dies!"<br />
Thank God his captors were deceived,<br />
He smiled amid the flame!<br />
And, with his fast expiring breath,<br />
These words bequeathed to fame:</p>

<p class="p23">"To suffer in a noble cause<br />
Is sweet beyond compare!<br />
These greedy flames that lick my blood<br />
But light a vision fair,<br />
Where heroism and heroes sweep<br />
The still resounding lyre,<br />
Heaven's harmonies have quenched<br />
The tortures of this fire!</p>

<p class="p23">"Tumultuous raptures 'round me roll<br />
Heaven's pearly gates ajar!<br />
My spirit soars on fleshless wing<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Beyond the faintest star!<br />
Oh, blissful death; oh, vision fair,<br />
What sweet celestial glories shine,<br />
The loved and lost of earlier years<br />
Are <i>now</i> forever mine!"</p>

<p class="p23">The savage horde in silence stood<br />
And listened as he sang,<br />
While even their untaught eyes could see<br />
He suffered not a pang!<br />
No yell triumphant smote his ear,<br />
Awe silenced every tongue,<br />
And many a heart beat faster<br />
As he his requiem sung.</p>

<p class="p23">Then lionhearted Conway,<br />
Beneath whose eagle eye<br />
Even savage foes once trembled<br />
Was offered up to die!<br />
Defiant still 'mid writhing flames,<br />
He heaped on them his scorn,<br />
And, with true prophetic voice<br />
He doomed their race unborn.</p>

<p class="p23">"Rejoice! rejoice! ye howling fiends,<br />
Distort your hideous face,<br />
Soon the white man's wrath shall sweep<br />
From earth your blood-stained race,<br />
While shining fields and cities fair<br />
Attest the white man's power,<br />
You accursed Creeks shall be<br />
Tradition's useless dower!"</p>

<p class="p23">Now comes your own ancestor,<br />
The gallant, brave McCray,<br />
Who planned this glorious campaign<br />
And led the awful fight.<br />
He was a perfect Hercules,<br />
Cast in Apollo's mould,<br />
With a heart of witching tenderness,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>Yet proud and dauntless soul.</p>

<p class="p23">Oft had he visited this tribe,<br />
On peaceful mission bent,<br />
And to many a savage<br />
His kind assistance lent.<br />
Yet little dreamed he, at this hour,<br />
One heart amid that throng<br />
Still beat responsive to his own,<br />
Attuned to love's mad song!</p>

<p class="p23">Yet, as they bound him to the stake<br />
And raised the flaming brand,<br />
The Chief that held it fell a corpse,<br />
Killed by a woman's hand!<br />
And Indian maiden loosed his bands<br />
And raised her voice on high:<br />
"Who harms my paleface lover<br />
By Tululah's hand shall die!"</p>

<p class="p23">Behold, the savage concourse stand,<br />
Transfixed by silent awe,<br />
And gaze upon Ocala's child,<br />
Held sacred by their law!<br />
They feared Ocala's spirit<br />
Might <i>then</i> be hovering nigh;<br />
Nor dared to harm his darling child,<br />
Lest he who harmed her die!</p>

<p class="p23">The Queen, with head and form erect,<br />
Bore McCray undismayed,<br />
And in her <i>father's</i> wigwam<br />
Her wounded lover laid!<br />
Then bending gently o'er him,<br />
Each wound she rightly dress,<br />
And with sweet plaintive melodies<br />
Lured the weary one to rest.</p>

<p class="p23">At dawning light McCray awoke,<br />
His Queen still lingering there;<br />
His eyes bespoke his gratitude,<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>His lips were moved in prayer<br />
For the lithe and graceful maiden<br />
Whose love he knew to be<br />
Pure as early morning's blush,<br />
Yet deathless as&mdash;Eternity!</p>

<p class="p23">Although once failed, his savage foes<br />
Still thirsted for his blood;<br />
The hate within their bosoms<br />
Was as tireless as a flood.<br />
Not daring open violence,<br />
They sought Oneida's craft,<br />
And 'neath the guise of friendship<br />
Gave the lovers a sleeping draught.</p>

<p class="p23">When the mighty god of slumber<br />
Had locked them fast in sleep,<br />
The wily savage entered,<br />
His fearful oath to keep.<br />
They took McCray to the river<br />
In sight of these roaring falls,<br />
Whose sheer descent&mdash;two hundred feet&mdash;<br />
The stoutest heart appalls!</p>

<p class="p23">They bound him fast in a frail canoe,<br />
Set adrift 'mid the current's flow,<br />
Believing his life would be dashed out<br />
On the jagged rocks below.<br />
Then, gladly turning homeward,<br />
A ready lie they make<br />
To appease her burning anger<br />
When Tululah shall awake!</p>

<p class="p23">Slowly the doomed man drifted,<br />
Yet faster, at each breath,<br />
The quickening current bore him<br />
To the open gates of death!<br />
Yet still he slept; aye, slept and dreamed<br />
Of the proud Creek's peerless flower<br />
Who, for deathless love of him,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Had braved her nation's power.</p>

<p class="p23">Spurned her murdered siris corpse<br />
And to his murderer clung!<br />
Aye, on the spot that drank his blood,<br />
Love's soothing ditties sung!<br />
Dreamed of the eyes that flashed with fire<br />
When his foeman dared draw nigh,<br />
Yet softened into tenderness<br />
At her lover's faintest sigh.</p>

<p class="p23">Dreams of the hand that sped the dart<br />
That pierced the chieftain's breast,<br />
Yet with such witching tenderness<br />
Could tremble in caress!<br />
Dreams of the heart that proudly braved<br />
A nation's deadly hate,<br />
Yet, at a lover's first command,<br />
Would brook a martyr's fate!</p>

<p class="p23">Dreams of the hour when Tululah,<br />
Who so bravely saved his life,<br />
Shall desert her baffled kinsman<br />
To become a white man's wife!<br />
Dreams how he would love and prize her,<br />
Shielding her with tenderest care,<br />
Spending time, and life, and fortune<br />
But to grant her lightest prayer.</p>

<p class="p23">But his dream is rudely broken,<br />
And his blanched lip loudly calls,<br />
For he hears the well known rumbling<br />
Of this river's awful falls.<br />
Life was sweet, death was so near,<br />
And he so young to die!<br />
No wonder that his trembling lips<br />
Sought mercy from on high.</p>

<p class="p23">He bore ten thousand tortures<br />
With every passing breath,<br />
As he lay bound and helpless,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>Gliding swiftly on to death.<br />
He raised his clarion voice<br />
Above the deafening roar;<br />
Great heavens! can a human cry<br />
Reach that resounding shore?</p>

<p class="p23">"Yes! Yes!" a once familiar voice<br />
Calls loudly from that shore,<br />
And a well known trapper woos time<br />
To life and hope once more!<br />
By an effort, born of hope renewed,<br />
McCray sprang to his feet;<br />
The trapper saw, his lariat flew,<br />
His outstretched hands to greet.</p>

<p class="p23">"<i>Steady!</i>" the practical huntsman cried:<br />
"Your peril is almost o'er;<br />
Steady, for in a moment<br />
Your foot shall press the shore!"<br />
Then, as he drew the skiff ashore,<br />
He recognized McCray,<br />
But gazed in silent wonder<br />
<i>For late raven locks were grey!</i></p>

<p class="p23">And never, to his dying day,<br />
Would McCray view the place<br />
Where, in suspended agony,<br />
He met death face to face!<br />
He shuddered at an Indian's name,<br />
And soon forgot the Queen,<br />
Who once so bravely saved him<br />
From a nation's senseless spleen.</p>

<p class="p23">He wooed and won a maiden<br />
Whose blue eyes, like your own,<br />
Held within their liquid depths,<br />
Love's nectarine full blown,<br />
And as I press your luscious lips<br />
I praise thee, brave McCray,<br />
Whose dauntless courage gave to me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>The girl I hold today!</p>

<p class="p23">Oh, yes; forgive me, darling,<br />
I did almost forget;<br />
But how can mortal silence keep<br />
By such sweet eyes beset?<br />
Grant me the boon of one more kiss<br />
And gaze into my face;<br />
Light fancy by your radiant eyes,<br />
Tululah's fate to trace!</p>

<p class="p23">Still let the pressure of your hand<br />
Chain me in rapture to the earth,<br />
For I must offer thoughts tonight<br />
That ne'er before had birth!<br />
No idle dreamer dares to pierce<br />
The mystery of this stream,<br />
Nor would I dare the bold emprise<br />
Save that your wish I deem</p>

<p class="p23">The highest law my loving heart<br />
Can now or ever know,<br />
And 'neath the witchery of your smile<br />
My raptured numbers glow!<br />
My fancy soars on eager wing,<br />
And will, perhaps, at last,<br />
Gladly at your high behest<br />
Unfold the misty past!</p>

<p class="p23">Tululah slept till evening shades<br />
Had deepened into night,<br />
And woke, alas! to find herself<br />
Bereft of her brave knight.<br />
Her Indian wit soon taught her<br />
Oguchu was to blame,<br />
And hastily she found him,<br />
Her eyes and cheeks aflame!</p>

<p class="p23">"Oguchu knows your mission;<br />
Your paleface lover fled<br />
While Tululah's starlit eyes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>Were wandering 'mid the dead.<br />
He is not worthy of your love;<br />
Let my sister choose a mate;<br />
Oguchu's lodge is open,<br />
Will my sister spurn her fate?"</p>

<p class="p23">"My paleface lover is a brave!"<br />
Tululah proudly cried;<br />
"<i>He</i> never fled from friend or foe,<br />
Oguchu, thou hast lied!<br />
Thy double tongue is poison-tipped,<br />
Thy words a coward's dart,<br />
Before I clasp thy loathsome form<br />
Let panthers rend my heart!</p>

<p class="p23">"Speak, coward, speak! where is my brave?<br />
Tululah asks you where;<br />
Speak, lest I summon by a word<br />
The friends of earth and air<br />
To tear your quivering limbs apart,<br />
You lying, treacherous chief.<br />
Speak the truth! you Indian dog,<br />
The night is growing brief!"</p>

<p class="p23">The awestruck chief is conquered,<br />
And tells, with bated breath,<br />
Where last he saw him drifting,<br />
Into the jaws of death!<br />
Tululah heard, and wild despair<br />
Hurled reason from her throne.<br />
Low at her feet the wretches crouched,<br />
Their treachery to atone!</p>

<p class="p23">"Up! Up, you cowards! Up, you knaves!<br />
And lead me to the place.<br />
Tululah's hand shall save him yet<br />
Or curse your coward race!<br />
'Tis mine to speak; yours, to obey;&mdash;<br />
I am your Virgin Queen:&mdash;<br />
I <i>swear</i> to save my lover <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Or <i>nevermore</i> be seen!"</p>

<p class="p23">They led her to the river,<br />
And, pointing to the place,<br />
They stood like criminals abashed<br />
Before the judge's face.<br />
She spurned their pleading counsel,<br />
And, springing in a boat,<br />
She cast the oars from her<br />
And set the skiff afloat!</p>

<p class="p23">Then, as she gazed adown the stream,<br />
Her eyes were all aglow<br />
With that deep yearning passion<br />
Such hearts alone can know.<br />
While sitting in the boat erect,<br />
With an Indian's willowy grace,<br />
She sang in tuneful numbers<br />
A song time can't efface:</p>

<p class="p24">"I am coming, coming, coming,<br />
Slowly drifting down the stream,</p>
<p class="p25">While my heart is yearning, yearning<br />
For the idol of love's dream.</p>

<p class="p24">"I have left them&mdash;left them&mdash;left them!<br />
Farewell, treacherous Indian race;</p>
<p class="p25">I can hear him calling, calling,<br />
And I go to seek his face.</p>

<p class="p24">"Now I'm gliding, gliding, gliding!<br />
And I hear the awful roar</p>
<p class="p25">Of the waters tumbling, tumbling,<br />
Where no boat will need an oar!</p>

<p class="p24">"Now I'm rushing, rushing, rushing!<br />
And the spray obscures my sight;</p>
<p class="p25">The angry waters leaping, leaping,<br />
Chill me with a strange affright.</p>

<p class="p24">"Oh, I see him! see him&mdash;see him,<br />
And I welcome death's alarms!</p>
<p class="p25">Oh! I'm swiftly falling, falling,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>And I spring into his arms!"</p>

<p class="p23">Not a trace of boat or maiden<br />
Could the savage searchers find,<br />
And they fled the spot in terror,<br />
Daring not to look behind!<br />
Nor would they tarry near the river,<br />
But moved their wigwam's far away;<br />
No savage Creek would linger<br />
Near the spot by night and day.</p>

<p class="p23">And tradition says her spirit<br />
May be seen on nights like this,<br />
When the heavy moon, mist-laden,<br />
Greets the river with a kiss!<br />
Not in vain will be our vigil<br />
If Tululah knows tonight<br />
In your precious veins is flowing<br />
Genuine blood of her brave knight!</p>

<p class="p23">Look!  Look! 'mid the river's silvery sheen<br />
Tululah's Phantom Boat is seen,<br />
While the air vibrates like a quivering lyre,<br />
Touched by the hands of an angel Choir!<br />
Oh, wondrous music soft and low,<br />
Like rippling streamlets' gentle flow!<br />
Oh, pathos laden, heart refrain,<br />
No mortal lips can breathe that strain!</p>

<p class="p23">Immortal love! not even death<br />
Can damp thy flame or chill thy breath!<br />
Nay, while eternal ages roll,<br />
'Tis thine to feed the hungry soul<br />
With manna dipped in passion's fire,<br />
True birthright of the heart's desire;<br />
Blest food no mortal lips can take<br />
And fail enrapturing bliss to wake!</p>

<p class="p23">Heaven's corner-stone, earth's chief delight.<br />
Tululah's captive soul tonight<br />
Is but living o'er the dream<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Thou didst create beside this stream.<br />
Her hapless fate all must deplore,<br />
Self-sacrificed in days of yore;<br />
And, could Tululah live again,<br />
At least one heart would soothe her pain!</p>

<p class="p23">The legend may be overdrawn,<br />
Yet 'tis not all a dream!<br />
Nor will you ever say again:<br />
"This is no haunted stream!"<br />
Other eyes beside our own<br />
Have seen the Phantom Boat,<br />
And other ears than ours have heard<br />
That wild, weird? music float!</p>

<p class="p23">But, precious little darling,<br />
As I strain thee to my breast,<br />
I am conscious you are weary,<br />
Thus deprived of needful rest.<br />
Let us hasten to thy cottage,<br />
Parting with a lingering kiss;<br />
Little Daisy, then, can slumber<br />
And awake in perfect bliss!</p>

<p class="p01">Years and years have passed away<br />
Since last we met, my darling wife;</p>
<p class="p02">Oft have I felt the tooth of pain<br />
Gnaw at the vitals of my life.</p>

<p class="p01">The brow thy hand has oft caressed<br />
With such sweet, hypnotic power,</p>
<p class="p02">The lines of care and grief has traced<br />
And wrinkled, like a withered flower.</p>

<p class="p01">The dark brown locks you loved so well,<br />
Now interspersed with silver thread,</p>
<p class="p02">Shows plainly that the march of time<br />
Has left its footprints on my head.</p>

<p class="p01">The deep gray eyes that once could flash<br />
With passion's fire, or melt in love,</p>
<p class="p02">Have lost the wanted fires of youth,<br />
Like some poor offcast, limpsy glove.</p>

<p class="p01">Yet in my breast there beats a heart<br />
That never will nor can grow old;</p>
<p class="p02">Thy image keeps its pulses warm<br />
With love that never shall grow cold.</p>

<p class="p01">Thy grace and beauty won that heart<br />
Long years ago, when thou wert young:</p>
<p class="p02">Thy gentle, generous, faithful care<br />
Has bred a love I cannot tongue.</p>

<p class="p01">Heaven can grant no sweeter bliss,<br />
To crown the evening of my life,</p>
<p class="p02">Than Iulu's sweet, enraptured kiss,<br />
When time restores me to my wife.</p>

<p class="p03 p1">In a cell of rock and iron,<br />
Where remorse and shame environ,<br />
Sat a convict sadly dreaming&mdash;<br />
Dreaming of the days of yore.<br />
Dreamed he of a land of flowers<br />
Where, amid Love's smiling bowers,<br />
He had spent such happy hours,<br />
To memory ne'er so sweet before.<br />
And he softly, fondly questioned:</p>
<p class="p22">"Shall I know such bliss once more?"<br />
Hope made answer, "<i>Yes, once more!</i>"</p>
<p class="p03">In a home which love had founded,<br />
Now by grief and care surrounded,<br />
Sat a wife and mother, weeping,</p>
<p class="p22">Weeping for her prisoned swain.</p>
<p class="p03">Wept she o'er fate's mad endeavor,<br />
That such loving hearts could sever,<br />
With a blow, that seemed to never<br />
Lose its agonizing pain;<br />
And her cry arose to heaven:</p>
<p class="p22">"Father, shall we meet again?"<br />
Mercy answered, "Once again."</p>
<p class="p03">Ope those doors of latticed iron,<br />
Lift the clouds that now environ;<br />
Faithfulness shall be rewarded&mdash;</p>
<p class="p22">Love the victory hath won.</p>
<p class="p03">Learn that I, your God, am heeding<br />
Prayers that rise from hearts now bleeding,<br />

<h2 class="p4"><i><span class="smcap">Ella Ree's Revenge.</span></i></h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="p23">Beside Saluda's silver stream,<br />
Where flowers nod and poets dream,<br />
A cabin stood, in days gone by,<br />
Whose history should never die.</p>

<p class="p23">Here lived and led a blameless life,<br />
Brave Hayward and his peerless wife,<br />
With three sweet pledges of that love,<br />
Cradled on earth, but born above.</p>

<p class="p23">Surrounding them, on every hand,<br />
Was the Red man's native land.<br />
No paleface, save themselves, ever dared<br />
To live in wild these Indians shared.</p>

<p class="p23">Treacherous alike in peace and war,<br />
The Seminole obeyed no law<br />
Save one he spake with bated breath:<br />
"Traitors shall die a coward's death!"</p>

<p class="p23">The haughty chief who led this tribe,<br />
Fear could not daunt nor favor bribe;<br />
And this lone settler, living here,<br />
Knew white man never dared come near.</p>

<p class="p23">He Caucanoe's heart had won<br />
By a kindness nobly done,<br />
In rescuing from a watery grave<br />
The favorite child of this fierce brave.</p>

<p class="p23">A frail canoe&mdash;swamped in mid stream:<br />
A father's cry&mdash;a maiden's scream;<br />
A hunter bearing a maid ashore,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>A volume writ would tell no more.</p>

<p class="p23">"The land beside this murmuring stream<br />
Thy future home, brave paleface, deem,<br />
And on Caucanoe's word depend,<br />
No Indian dares molest my friend!"</p>

<p class="p23">"Yours 'twas to save Caucanoe's pride,<br />
Mine be it to protect your bride;<br />
If here a future you would seek,<br />
I listen: Let my brother speak."</p>

<p class="p23">"Great Chief! your words, so kind and true,<br />
Fall on my ears like evening dew;<br />
Ere the buds begin to swell<br />
Your brother 'mid your tribe shall dwell."</p>

<p class="p23">So Hayward built, with eager haste,<br />
As best befits a woman's taste,<br />
A cabin palace, reared by art,<br />
Each room as secret as your heart.</p>

<p class="p23">Here they lived and tilled the ground,<br />
The happiest pair for miles around;<br />
The Indians swarmed around their door<br />
With useful gifts to swell their store.</p>

<p class="p23">Caucanoe often sought their door<br />
And played with the children, o'er and o'er.<br />
He brought them many a curious toy,<br />
Their happy childhood to employ.</p>

<p class="p23">The winsome sprite, who sat on his knee,<br />
Pleased him most of the guileless three;<br />
Her limped eyes and golden hair<br />
Caucanoe thought divinely fair.</p>

<p class="p23">As the happy years flew swiftly by,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Beneath Caucanoe's watchful eye,<br />
Paralee grew, with rapid pace,<br />
Into a maid of faultless grace.</p>

<p class="p23">Caucanoe loved this lovely child<br />
With a passion fierce, and deep, and wild,<br />
Yet hopeless, he feared, that love would be,<br />
Since naught could bridge the raging sea</p>

<p class="p23">Of racial and tribal pride,<br />
That lay between them, deep and wide;<br />
And well he knew another's soul<br />
Brooked naught on earth save his control.</p>

<p class="p23">King Ulca's daughter, the proud Ella Ree,<br />
Graceful and lithe as a willow tree,<br />
With eyes and hair like the raven's wing,<br />
And voice as soft as the babbling spring,</p>

<p class="p23">Had sought him for her wigwam brave,<br />
Weeping o'er his late wife's grave;<br />
And well he knew the tears she shed,<br />
By tribal law their bodies wed.</p>

<p class="p23">True love for her he could not feel,<br />
Yet such a fact dared not reveal;<br />
His squaw she was alone in name<br />
And never to his wigwam came.</p>

<p class="p23">Another love, oh, fateful thought!<br />
With direful misery doubly fraught,<br />
Surged and tossed within his soul<br />
Until it spurned his late control.</p>

<p class="p23">At last he sought her much loved side<br />
And begged her to become his bride.<br />
The maiden heard and laughed outright,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>And thus let loose the fiends of night</p>

<p class="p23">That of late had lain at rest<br />
Within Caucanoe's savage breast.<br />
Now, naught could stay this rising ire<br />
Save to light the Council Fire.</p>

<p class="p23">At last among his braves he stood,<br />
Like some monarch of the wood;<br />
While burning words flowed from his tongue,<br />
That showed how deep his heart was wrung.</p>

<p class="p23">The Council heard and thus decreed:<br />
"Our land from paleface dogs be freed.<br />
Tomorrow night the proud paleface<br />
Shall rue Caucanoe's late disgrace!"</p>

<p class="p23">"'Tis well," the haughty chief replied;<br />
"Who scorns to be Caucanoe's bride<br />
Shall feel a living flame of fire<br />
Quench the last spark of life's desire!"</p>

<p class="p23">But, ere the morrow's sun had set,<br />
Awakening love brought deep regret.<br />
Love fought the savage till he fell,<br />
And Pity's tears began to well.</p>

<p class="p23">He crept the cabin light within,<br />
And there confessed his double sin.<br />
"'Tis done," he cried, "you shall not die;<br />
The boat is ready; up, and fly!</p>

<p class="p23">"Saluda's stream shall guide you right,<br />
Caucanoe lays to die tonight!<br />
Once you are free, I die content.<br />
Nor deem the blow untimely sent."</p>

<p class="p23">The boat has left the silent shore,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>And Hayward tugs at the muffled oar;<br />
The craft sweeps on, like a thing of life,<br />
Impelled by the prayers of a weeping wife.</p>

<p class="p23">Caucanoe stood on the bank hard by,<br />
With heaving breast and tear-dimmed eye,<br />
That proved a hero's soul could rest<br />
In the natural dome of a savage breast.</p>

<p class="p23">The flashing oars in the moonlight pale<br />
Give forth no sound and leave no trail;<br />
Naught is heard save the breath<br />
Of the fleeing ones in their race with death.</p>

<p class="p23">Hark! What means that frightful yell?<br />
'Tis a cry of triumph, born of hell;<br />
Their savage foe, long under way,<br />
At last have seen their wanted prey.</p>

<p class="p23">They see the foe and wildly fly<br />
The flashing oars, till they almost fly;<br />
"We'll yet be saved," brave Hayward spoke,<br />
But his oars shivered beneath his stroke.</p>

<p class="p23">He sprang to his feet, with ashen face,<br />
And his trusty rifle flew to its place;<br />
A maddening yell from the savage crew<br />
Proved the ball to the mark had straightway flew.</p>

<p class="p23">Six times his trusty rifle spoke;<br />
Each time an Indian skull it broke.<br />
His gallant sons stood near their sire<br />
And reinforced his deadly fire!</p>

<p class="p23">Their doom was sealed. The savage horde<br />
Soon reached their bark and sprang aboard;<br />
Yet scorned they even then to yield,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>While strength was left a knife to wield.</p>

<p class="p23">Each one dared a hero's part;<br />
Each knife it sought a savage heart,<br />
Nor did they cease to bathe in gore<br />
Till they sank beneath to rise no more.</p>

<p class="p23">Paralee and her mother lay<br />
To savage hands an early prey;<br />
For neither knew, nor felt they ought,<br />
Of what they did or what they sought,</p>

<p class="p23">Since terror and alarm, too deep,<br />
Had locked their senses all in sleep.<br />
Alas! that they should ever wake:<br />
Returning senses meant the stake.</p>

<p class="p23">Soon homeward with the living dead<br />
The savage horde in triumph sped;<br />
And bore to haunts of Ella Ree<br />
The paleface foe she longed to see.</p>

<p class="p23">Better for Paralee had she died<br />
Amid the battle's raging tide.<br />
"Not wounded tigress in her lair<br />
More dangerous than a jealous fair!"</p>

<p class="p23">Assembled around the Council Fire,<br />
With haughty mien and rising ire,<br />
Each chief was ready to relate<br />
His own exploit or vent his hate.</p>

<p class="p23">Safely bound by cruel thong,<br />
In the center of the throng,<br />
The captives sat in silent dread,<br />
Envying none except the dead.</p>

<p class="p23">"Brothers! the paleface Ella Ree,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>Whose words from guile are always free,<br />
Will tell you all you need to know.<br />
Who scorns <i>her</i> words must brave my blow!"</p>

<p class="p23">Thus Ulca spake, then glared around<br />
With a mighty monarch's haughty frown,<br />
"That held his hearers more in awe<br />
Of his dread prowess than his law."</p>

<p class="p23">"Chief! Warriors! Braves in battle tried,<br />
Your blood Saluda's stream has dyed;<br />
Your brothers sleep no more to wake!<br />
Will <i>you</i> sit by nor vengeance take?"</p>

<p class="p23">"A traitor warned the doomed paleface;<br />
Shall <i>he</i> yet live to brave our race?<br />
How the white lily wrought the spell,<br />

<p class="p23">"Caucanoe does not fear to die!<br />
'Twas he that bade the paleface fly;<br />
Let these women now be set free;<br />
Vent your hate alone on me."</p>

It shall be thus," brave Ulca spake.<br />
"If love shall brave the cruel flame,<br />
Yon captives go from whence they came."</p>

And bade the Chief his place to take.<br />
He lightly stepped in proper place,<br />

<p class="p23">The signal given&mdash;a lighted brand&mdash;<br />
Ella Ree raised with trembling hand,<br />
Yet begged Caucanoe not to die,<br />
But to her willing arms to fly.</p>

<p class="p23">Pardon was his, both full and free,<br />
As the proud brave of Ella Ree;<br />
The hated captives should atone<br />
For all blood spilt, and they alone!</p>

<p class="p23">Caucanoe frowned and thus replied:<br />
"If Ella Ree would be my bride,<br />
Let her light the fire and stand<br />
Here beside me, hand in hand."</p>

Even in death a happy bride!<br />
Saluda's stream is never free<br />
From the dying chant of Ella Ree!</p>

<p class="pl1">Ye glittering stars! how fair ye shine tonight.</p>
<p class="pl0">And, oh, thou modest moon! thy silvery light</p>
<p class="pl0">Comes streaming through these iron bars before me.</p>
<p class="pl0">How clear and silent is this lovely night!</p>
<p class="pl0">How quiet and how bright!</p>
<p class="pl0">I nothing hear, nor aught can hear</p>
<p class="pl0">Me when I speak, but stone and iron that I fear;</p>
<p class="pl0">I, shunned by all, as if alone I'd go to Hell;</p>
<p class="pl0">I, alone in chains! Ah, me, the cruel spell</p>
<p class="pl0">That brought me here. Heaven could not cheer me</p>
<p class="pl0">Within these cursed walls&mdash;within this dark and dreary cell,</p>
<p class="pl0">This gloomy, cold, and solitary Hell.</p>

<p class="pl1">And thou, O Time! the only thing that's not my foe&mdash;</p>
<p class="pl0">O Time! O Time! thou passeth on so slow,</p>
<p class="pl0">Keeping my soul in terror, in bondage, and in woe;</p>

<p class="pl0">Must I this torture feel, year after year?</p>
<p class="pl0">Live, die in Hell, and yet a Paradise so near?</p>
<p class="pl0">Wilt Thou, Oh, God! wilt Thou not hear? 'Tis I, 'tis I they all do fear.</p>

<p class="pl1">Am I to Thee, O Christ, as dead? Thou who sought</p>
<p class="pl0">The lonely prisoner in his dismal cell, and to him taught</p>
<p class="pl0">The true and only law to govern man&mdash;Thy love,</p>
<p class="pl0">Which can be only reached by prayer to Thee above?</p>

<p class="pl0">Ah, me, ah, me, 'tis love Thou sayest&mdash;love.</p>

<p class="pl0">And for my cruel, wicked crime no joy above all this?</p>
<p class="pl0">What, world of sin! What, never? Is my destiny Hell?</p>
<p class="pl0">Is that my cruel sentence because in sin I fell?</p>
<p class="pl0">Aye, I did fall! Into that dark and fathomless pit,</p>
<p class="pl0">And now in Hell my soul has fell, and for Hell it is not fit:</p>
<p class="pl0">Into that misery eternal, where nothing lives but all's infernal&mdash;</p>

<p class="pl0">My thoughts they burn my head, my heart 'twas, ah, 'twas dead&mdash;</p>

<p class="pl0">Those pains, and, severe as they were, they flew, yes, flew away,</p>
<p class="pl0">And being absent for awhile, remorse came in by day.</p>

<p class="pl1">Oh, God, Oh, God, I am not fit for this infernal Hell!</p>
<p class="pl0">Oh, mercy, mercy! my destiny, 'tis here that I must dwell.</p>
<p class="pl0">Away! away! ye fiery fiends, I am among you now,</p>
<p class="pl0">O Christ, O Savior of the sinner! To Satan must I bow?</p>

<p class="pl0">And let me live anew my life and see if I will fall.</p>
<p class="pl0">Test me, test me once again, let me hear the old church bell,</p>

<p class="pl0">What! can it be they look like men and 'stead of hearts they have but sin</p>

<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>They sneer and stare at me! Go 'way, ye devils cooked in sin and crime!</p>

<p class="pl0">When by the law of a just God I'll be removed from here,</p>
<p class="pl0">And by the law of Christ divine, of thee I'll have no fear.</p>

<p class="pl1">Hark! List! From yonder corner comes loud cries,</p>
<p class="pl0">Oh, let me hold my aching, bursting head!</p>
<p class="pl0">They come from some poor wretch that dies,</p>
<p class="pl0">And many an one may mourn him now as dead.</p>
<p class="pl0">I see him! I see him! There he is! My murdered victim now</p>
<p class="pl0">Appears before me. That is him! and to him I must bow.</p>
<p class="pl0">Oh, his cries, his groans, they haunt me</p>
<p class="pl0">To the bottom of my wicked heart. Can it be</p>
<p class="pl0">That I must dwell forever in this wretched misery?</p>
<p class="pl0">Horrors! See him now reach out his bony hand</p>
<p class="pl0">To grasp me firmly by the throat and hold me like a band.</p>
<p class="pl0">Take me, demons, if you please, take me into Hell!</p>
<p class="pl0">Anything you choose may do&mdash;remove me from this cell!</p>

<p class="pl1">My soul, my soul, awake! awake! They come! they come!</p>
<p class="pl0">The devil's come to take&mdash;Old Satan, I am thine!</p>
<p class="pl0">Away my soul will ever roll through torturing, scorching Hell,</p>
<p class="pl0">And down into the blackest depths my soul is cast pell-mell.</p>
<p class="pl0">Oh, what a fate for man to meet&mdash;speak, Satan! speak, I say!</p>
<p class="pl0">And with your torturing, devilish deeds&mdash;my ruin! no delay!</p>
<p class="pl0">What dumb! Old Satan, canst thou speak? Look here</p>
<p class="pl0">And speak thy want! I'm now right crisp and hard in sin and haven't any fear.</p>
<p class="pl0">Take me, demons! Take me, quick! I hear the awful knell</p>
<p class="pl0">Of the roaring, moaning billows, and the bitterness of Hell.</p>
<p class="pl0">Take me, Satan, take me! as my fate is firmly sealed,</p>
<p class="pl0">While ye in Hades do wake me, and o'er me the batoon wield.</p>

<p class="pl1">What! What! Am I mistaken? Was it only but a dream?</p>
<p class="pl0">I, still living here on earth&mdash;oh, how real it all did seem.</p>
<p class="pl0">Could I now just one chance have and in mercy be forgiven,</p>
<p class="pl0">I would have respect for all and send prayers right up to heaven.</p>
<p class="pl0">When on earth Christ did come to save sinners from their fate,</p>
<p class="pl0">Any time they'd turn to Him they'd find 'twas not too late.</p>

<p class="pl0">Now, to Thee let me give thanks, 'cause 'twas only a bad dream.</p>
<p class="pl0">But its horrors to me cling, 'cause so real it all did seem.</p>

<p class="p01">But there's one thing safe to wager on,</p>
<p class="p02">"<span class="smcap">That mind's the standard of the Man</span>."</p>

<p class="p01">In here you'll find there's many a mind<br />
As free from sin and crime</p>
<p class="p01">As congressmen and senators<br />
Who've been there a long time.</p>
<p class="p01">Some of these men in here, you see,<br />
They got a little tight,</p>
<p class="p01">And broke into a chicken coop,<br />
Because 'twas in the night.</p>
<p class="p01">Some men you see as you walk with me<br />
Down through these halls so dreary,</p>
<p class="p01">Have, on bended knee, prayed to be free<br />
Until life's become weary.</p>
<p class="p01">They have no money, neither friends,<br />
Because they're far behind the van,</p>
<p class="p01">But still 'tis safe to wager</p>
<p class="p02">"<span class="smcap">That mind's the standard of the Man</span>."</p>

<p class="p01">And now because my enemies<br />
Have chained me tight and fast,</p>
<p class="p01">And cruel, heartless, brutal curs<br />
Would hold me to the last&mdash;</p>
<p class="p01">Look here! I'll freely now submit,<br />
Turn on your cathode rays</p>
<p class="p01">And learn, if now 'tis not too late,<br />
The evil of my ways.</p>
<p class="p01"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Then go up to that old bribed judge,<br />
And prosecutor, too,</p>
<p class="p01">And bring their conscience here by mine<br />
And search all through and through.</p>
<p class="p01">Look sharp! And now compare their minds<br />
With this one, if you can,</p>
<p class="p01">And then apply the golden rule,</p>
<p class="p02">"<span class="smcap">That mind's the standard of the Man</span>."</p>

<p class="p01">Oh, men of science! if you can<br />
Employ the cathode rays</p>
<p class="p01">To take the place of jurymen<br />
In those our latter days;</p>
<p class="p01">Let not a man upon the bench<br />
To judge another's fate,</p>
<p class="p01">Until to cathode he's been sent<br />
To search beneath his pate!</p>
<p class="p01">If then you see his mind is free<br />
From prejudice and crime,</p>
<p class="p01">And he'll give us all fair justice,<br />
Let him sit there all the time!</p>
<p class="p01">But if, upon the other hand,<br />
He won't, although he can,</p>
<p class="p01">Then cut him out with the golden rule:</p>
<p class="p02">"<span class="smcap">That mind's the standard of the Man</span>."</p>

<p class="p01">How can you, then, a prisoner make,<br />
When his Mind's as free as space?</p>
<p class="p01">You may chain his feet, and hands, and neck,<br />
And tightly bind his face,</p>
<p class="p01">Do what you please, and as you please,<br />
You cannot help but see&mdash;</p>
<p class="p01">That man is man, where e'er he be,<br />
Because his mind is free!</p>
<p class="p01">His mind may roam back to his home,<br />
You cannot tie it down,</p>
<p class="p01">And folk may look, and scoff, and scowl,<br />
And always wear a frown.</p>
<p class="p01">But when of him they a prisoner make,<br />
The mind they never can,</p>
<p class="p01">'Cause God ordained the Golden Rule,</p>
<p class="p02">"<span class="smcap">That mind's the standard of the Man</span>."</p>

<p class="p23 p1">In the headlong rush for the Land of Fame<br />
How many are wrecked on the Isle of Shame.<br />
How few heads wear a glittering crown<br />
In the far-away realm of great renown.<br />
'Mid the crowded ranks of the legion of greed<br />
How many are crushed 'neath the wheels of need!</p>

<p class="p23">How few ever feel the dainty caress<br />
Of the lingering hand of great success!<br />
In the mad pursuit of the god of gold<br />
What brains are wrecked, what hearts grow cold!<br />
How many will spend their latest day<br />
'Mid the hurtling waters of Poverty Bay!</p>

<p class="p23">How many are lured by a siren chime<br />
To a double death in the land of Crime!<br />
How few escape, unscarred, within<br />
The winding walks of the maze of sin!<br />
How many that towered above the stars<br />
Now pine and languish behind the bars!</p>

<p class="p23">What a trail of woe a single mistake<br />
Across the page of a life can make!<br />
O, shipwrecked sailor, fix your eye<br />
On the Star of Hope in yonder sky;<br />
Mercy's hand will bring release<br />
And safely lead to the Land of Peace.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><i>THE AUTHOR'S FAREWELL.</i></h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pl1">Gentle reader, this small volume clearly proves that modern man</p>
<p class="pl0">Can control his erring brothers with a clear enlightened plan.</p>
<p class="pl0">Ne'er till now have prison printers voiced, unchanged, a convict's tho't!</p>
<p class="pl0">Is the change with retrogression or with onward progress fraught?</p>
<p class="pl0">Will this volume change your custom or relieve our horrid pain?</p>
<p class="pl0">Or shall truth be crushed and bleeding, ever bound in prison chain?</p>
<p class="pl0">Will you cast your glances backward, gathering age along by age,</p>
<p class="pl0">Proof that man is wholly brutal when controlled by maddening rage?</p>
<p class="pl0">View the pen of downy feathers, where men choked and choked to death,</p>
<p class="pl0">Without power to ask for pardon with their last expiring breath!</p>
<p class="pl0">See your brother in that river, safely chained to yonder rock,</p>
<p class="pl0">While his thirst is wildly raging and the waves his tortures mock!</p>
<p class="pl0">See yon dungeon, dark and dreary, built by human art and skill,</p>
<p class="pl0">Whose dread mission is to madden any one the <i>law</i> says kill!</p>
<p class="pl0">Visit to the hapless culprit, as in Pagan jail he lies;</p>
<p class="pl0">See the jailer pass the hemlock, which he quaffs, and then he dies!</p>
<p class="pl0">Think of club, of sword and pistol, of the bloody guillotine;</p>
<p class="pl0">Of the whipcord, knout and gallows of the noted Wolverine;</p>
<p class="pl0">Of starvation, rack and torture, of the lash and fiery stake,</p>
<p class="pl0">And then tell me frankly, reader, did these wrongs one virtue wake?</p>

<p class="pl1">Tell me frankly, honest reader, can two wrongs create a right?</p>
<p class="pl0">And is man's inhuman conduct pleasing in Jehovah's sight?</p>
<p class="pl0">Or do pitying angels shudder, as the cruel lash you ply,</p>
<p class="pl0">Wondering man can be so brutal and the laws of God defy?</p>
<p class="pl0">Does not conscience loudly thunder: "Sin is but the fruit of hate,</p>
<p class="pl0">And who stones a helpless brother most deserves that victim's fate?</p>
<p class="pl0">Can abuse and brutal treatment purge the sinner of his guilt?</p>
<p class="pl0">If so, <i>come</i>, within my bosom sheath your dagger to the hilt!</p>
<p class="pl0">Strike, till every erring mortal at your hands has met his fate,</p>
<p class="pl0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Then sit down and calmly ponder on your awful lonely state!</p>
<p class="pl0"><i>You</i>, perhaps, have been quite <i>faultless</i>; <i>you</i>, perhaps, no <i>wrong</i> have done,</p>
<p class="pl0">If 'tis <i>true</i>, my peerless brother, <i>you're alone beneath the sun</i>"!</p>

<p class="pl1">Do but think! we once were spotless as the babe on mother's knee!</p>
<p class="pl0">Trace the causes of our downfall with a mind from malice free.</p>
<p class="pl0">See, on every licensed corner, fiends incarnate hourly sell</p>
<p class="pl0">Fiery waters of <i>damnation</i>, that create <i>a living hell!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">Women, once as pure as angels, leading heartless lives of shame;</p>
<p class="pl0">For the trumpery of fashion dealing off both home and name!</p>
<p class="pl0">Hear men laud the wealthy scoundrel and attempt to clear his ways,</p>
<p class="pl0">While the poor and honest toiler <i>none</i> with pride or pleasure pays!</p>
<p class="pl0">See Religion don the garments of all worldly pride and lust,</p>
<p class="pl0">While the Savior's honest followers are but trampled in the dust!</p>
<p class="pl0">See the press, with startling headlines, every vice and sin portray</p>
<p class="pl0">That can sink your moral standard or lead innocence astray!</p>
<p class="pl0">View the legions of temptation strewn along the path of youth,</p>
<p class="pl0">See how few do practice virtue, and how few <i>adore</i> the truth!</p>
<p class="pl0">There! the cause of crime is patent, and our downfall you behold,</p>
<p class="pl0">To condemn it in a sentence: "<i>It was women, wine and gold!</i>"</p>

<p class="pl1">If you read this book with caution, you have read <i>between the lines</i>,</p>
<p class="pl0">Learning much the careless reader and the critic ne'er divines!</p>
<p class="pl0">You have seen the author's purpose was to tell the simple truth,</p>
<p class="pl0">As a tribute to the prisoner and a warning to our youth.</p>
<p class="pl0">You have seen mistakes and errors that less haste would quickly mend,</p>
<p class="pl0">Yet, with all its imperfections, it may prove a useful friend.</p>
<p class="pl0">And in future I may publish one with less of hasty thought</p>
<p class="pl0">That may be&mdash;God knows the future&mdash;with undying issues fraught.</p>
<p class="pl0">All tried means have proved abortive yet, my friend, there is a plan</p>
<p class="pl0">That <i>will</i> lift each erring brother <i>to the standard of a man!</i></p>
<p class="pl0">If I can but live to publish what I <i>know</i> and long to tell,</p>
<p class="pl0">You <i>will</i> read it and believe it; so, dear reader, <i>fare-thee-well!</i></p>

Go, little book, thy destined course pursue!<br />
Collect memorials of the just and true;<br />

Attach them to thee with both soul and mind;<br />
And if they prove good, faithful friends and true,<br />
To them thou sticketh, as if they loved you&mdash;</p>
